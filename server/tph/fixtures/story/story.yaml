      <p>You and your team of Interplanetary Theorists awaken to find yourself in a massive cave and cavern: the throne room, apparently, of the recently-deposed Hades/Pluto. It’s eerily quiet except for the sound of a dog panting, in the deepest audio register you’ve ever heard. No, make that three dogs... No, wait a minute...</p>

      <p>Huffing and puffing as you calm down from racing the slobber machine Cerberus around the throne room- after you both successfully <span class="font-mono">GO BAR HOPPING</span>, of course- he runs behind the throne itself. At first you worry you’ll need to chase him further, but he reappears a moment later and deposits a chewed-up pair of fuzzy slippers at your feet, and barks urgently. You’re not sure why these are so important, but he clearly doesn’t want you to leave without them. Congrats! They’re slimy, ragged, and now in your inventory.<p>

      <p>“That was the best judicial proceeding I’ve seen in a long time! I know, justice and blindness and all that hokey, so I don’t see much at all...” she gasps out between peals of laughter as she sprints alongside you.

You really weren't expecting something so literal, but then again, neither were the Judges.</p>

      <p>Poking around the caverns, you found a suspicious hole in the ceiling. Curious. Wasn’t this the part of the cosmos you and the other Interplanetary Theorists were doing critical research on before the meeting occurred? It seems there’s a god up above not so happy with what happened to you lot, and he, she, they... whoever they are, they’re offering some celestial guidance. You think this person might be behind the times and <b>you are quite sure whatever’s up there isn’t necessary for getting out of Hades</b> but maybe this was the extra help Hermes was talking about? Regardless, it’s not your highest priority to sort whatever this is out, but it’s definitely something to come back to if you think you’re feeling stuck or overwhelmed.</p>

      <p>You don’t know what’s inside the locked case you stole. You just know that whatever it is, it will help you escape. As you stare at it, you hear Cerberus sniffing around—three noses means triple the noise. You turn to see him pick up Charon’s oar in his mouths like it was an oversized chew toy. He starts jumping around, meaning to play, wildly flailing the oar. You jump out of the way as *THWACK*—the oar makes solid contact with the case, sending it flying across the chamber. The case collides with a sharp stalagmite, and the contents spill out! You rush over and find a note, a sealed envelope, and…a Walkman? You’ve busted the case—now it’s time to bust out of Hades.</p>

        <p>Escape! Air! And... more work to do??!?!?</p>
        <p>Hermes met us at the exit, and gave us the details. The short version is this: sure, we have re-entered the mortal realm, but Hades-Pluto- the god of the Underworld, <u>that guy</u>, well, he kind of holds the universe all together. We broke him, so we should really be fixing him. And we can! Hades, like many gods, wasn’t just known for being the god of only one thing- he was worshiped for many smaller aspects, from wealth to love. If we gathered up pieces of his essence- shades of it- we might just be able to reassemble him. If a strong thought can break him, an equally potent one should be able to set things right. In fact, we already have a few shades- the slippers from Cerberus, the blindfold from the Judges, and the oar from Charon, just to name a few.</p>
        <p>Come to think of it, the Oracles should have some updated information on what we’ve really found down in Hades. Maybe it’s worth paying them a visit.</p>
        <p>Hermes gave us one of his sandals to help with the task, which he transformed into a Mercury station wagon for our convenience, and Cerberus is coming along for the ride to help find his master.</p>
        <p>We can zip around the US in an instant in this thing! We have no time to waste: Cerberus’s strong nose can track down where other shades of Pluto might be hiding, but we’ll have to extract them ourselves by any means necessary, lest things get worse.</p>
        <p>And fast.</p>

      <p>Poseidon tunes up his ol’ banjo and gives you a Southern-fried version of the tale of Scylla and Charybdis, who occupy both sides of the Mississippi River. Seems Granny Charybdis was doing good business selling her pie to passing riverboats, until young Miss Scylla turned up on the opposite shore, dishing out stew. One poisoned pie and poisoned bowl of stew later, and they turned into the monstrosities we all know and despise: a giant whirlpool and a hideous monster with six demon dog-heads for knees. Poseidon will help us dredge out the shade of his poor brother from the ol’ Miss, once you deal with these two shore-hoggin’ monstrosities!</p>

      <p>Scylla’s deadly talons are screeching right at you, so you can’t go left... and Charybdis’ maw is still slurping away, so you can’t go right, but you can... go under! Gripping the gearshift on the Mercury, you <span class="font-mono">PUT IT IN DIVE</span> and splash beneath the surface... not a moment too soon! Thrown off balance, Scylla hurtles through the space where you were a moment ago, and lands with a thud...right in the middle of Charybdis’ drinkin’ straw! While the two of them are trying to untangle themselves, Poseidon pops a worm onto his fishhook and starts dredging the river bottom.</p>
      <p>“I got a bite!” he announces, and reels in... a muddy old boot. He looks at it and laughs. “That’s my brother, all right,” he chuckles, tossing the boot to you. “Most folks who dredge something up from the <span className="text-amber-500">DARKNESS BELOW</span> toss it back into the depths just as quickly. Pluto knew it was better to get it out in the open than quashin’ it down and lettin’ it fester, so don’t you go throwin’ that back now, y’hear?”</p>

      <p>As the last statue left standing collapses (luckily, directly onto the last zombie still standing), you survey the wreckage of the once perfectly manicured garden. Luckily, you managed to <span class="font-mono">PALM A GRANITE</span> in all the confusion, so now might be a good time to make a hasty exit.

      <p>“Forget the plants!” snaps Persephone, “Those were my favorite corpses!” She senses the heart-shaped chunk of stone you’re carrying. “And that, I believe, is from Pluto’s favorite statue.” She suddenly grows wistful. “It was a sculpture of me, the <span className="text-amber-500">LOVE</span> of his life, in my younger days, doing a bit of body building.”</p>
      <p>Before you can comment that you didn’t know she lifted weights, she concludes, “I was building them into a scale model of the Eiffel Tower.”</p>
