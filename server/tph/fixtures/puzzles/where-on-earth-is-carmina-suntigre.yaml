    keywords: start, begin
    content: The puzzle is based on the old computer game series WHERE IN THE WORLD
      IS CARMEN SANDIEGO? As the flavor text indicates, you'll need to figure out
      which of Carmina Suntigre's henchmen committed each crime by comparing the information
      on their wanted posters to the witness' statements. However, a good place to
      start might be to solve the capitalized crossword-style clues in the crime descriptions.

    order: 1.0
    keywords: logic, crime
    content: "Most of the witness' statements could apply to two of Carmina's henchmen.\
      \ However, by combining multiple statements, or by process of elimination, some\
      \ can be narrowed down to a single suspect:\r\n- The only one that could apply\
      \ to the Inspector is the DOMINICAN crime.\r\n- The only one that could apply\
      \ to the Electrician is the SAINT LUCIAN crime.\r\n- The only one that could\
      \ apply to the Magician is the JAMAICAN crime.\r\n- The only suspect that fits\
      \ the FRENCH crime's description is the Archer.\r\n- While acetone could be\
      \ used by a Chemist or a Painter (or possibly a Genetic Engineer), only the\
      \ Chemist has green eyes (and cats can't verbally ask for specific items), so\
      \ the HAITIAN crime was committed by the Chemist.\r\nWith this information,\
      \ you should be able to match the remaining suspects to their crimes."

    order: 2.1
    keywords: solved logic, what to match
    content: Take a look at the matched words MAGICIAN and JAMAICAN. If you cross
      out the letters that appear in each (including two of the three A's in JAMAICAN
      because there are only two A's in MAGICIAN, and one of the I's in MAGICIAN because
      there is only one I in JAMAICAN), you are left with the letters AIJG. These
      four letters should look very similar to one of the as-yet-unused aspects of
      the puzzle.

    keywords: leftover letters, remaining letters
    content: Each clued word contains all of the unmatched letters (i.e., the letters
      remaining after all matching letters are crossed out) from the alias-demonym
      pairs, except for one spare letter. The spare unused letters can be arranged
      to form the name of a final crime.

    order: 3.0
    keywords: order, ordering
    content: All of the crimes have a timestamp, listed in "local time." All of the
      countries in question are single-time-zone countries. By converting the "local
      times" to UTC, we find that the first crime (Croatia) occurred at 7:00 AM UTC,
      with one crime occurring every subsequent hour until 6:00 PM UTC (Bangladesh).
      This is the correct ordering for the puzzle.

    order: 4.1
    keywords: a great ambush, final, last
    content: You'll have to solve in reverse, so to speak. For the other crimes, you
      lined up the names of the criminals and the demonyms to find a remaining clue
      word/phrase. Here, we have the clue word (A GREAT AMBUSH) and the criminal (SUNTIGRE,
      listed in all-caps like the other criminals' aliases), so we need to figure
      out what demonym can line up with SUNTIGRE to leave the leftover letters A GREAT
      AMBUSH (no extra letter this time!). Note that the letters SUTGRE (half of the
      phrase) come from SUNTIGRE, so the other half must come from the demonym, while
      the remaining letters in SUNTIGRE must also appear in the demonym (to be crossed
      out).
