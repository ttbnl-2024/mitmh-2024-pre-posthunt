    keywords: extraction, runners-up, 3rd, place
    content: Use the numbers at the end to extract from the word each spelling bee
      runner-up misspelled. The records for one very old spelling bee suggest the
      concept of the winner having to spell another "winning" word after spelling
      the runner-up's word correctly hadn't been invented yet. For that bee, use the
      word misspelled by the 3rd place finisher.
