    keywords: getting started, start
    content: All eight pictures have something in common.  If you're having difficulty
      identifying what that commonality is, note that the title contains the word
      "assembly" and the flavortext contains the word "set" - do those words suggest
      anything to you?

    order: 10.1
    keywords: getting started, start
    content: It is possible to assemble items either directly depicted in, or strongly
      related to, each of the eight pictures, using pieces - often hundreds of pieces
      - sold in sets by the same manufacturer.  Now that you know this, step on it
      and solve the puzzle already!  (... wait, no, don't step on it! it HURTS if
      you do so.)

    description: Solvers have identified the Lego sets but are unsure as to what to
      do next
    order: 50.0
    keywords: set theory, stuck
    content: The "set theory" associated with this puzzle is not the traditional mathematical
      set theory.  Solvers are meant to infer the actual meaning of the operators
      and functions in this form of set theory using the eight provided equations.  Note
      that converting the constants in the listed equations defining the values A
      through Z using alphabet position (1=A, 2=B) will nudge you towards how to determine
      what this puzzle's set theory actually is.

    description: Solvers have identified the Lego sets but are unsure as to what to
      do next (2)
    order: 50.1
    keywords: set theory, stuck
    content: The "set theory" in this puzzle has some specialized functions and operators
      which are specific to the Lego (TM) sets and the brickset numbers associated
      with them, which are meant to be inferred using the eight provided equations.  Possibly
      the trickiest of these functions and operators is the cardinality function (|N|),
      which is a function for obtaining the number of pieces in the Lego (TM) set
      with the brickset number of N; the others should be easier to infer, especially
      by analogy to actual Set Theory operations

    keywords: values, extraction
    content: Once you have identified the meanings of the functions and operators
      in this puzzle's version of set theory, it is possible to calculate the values
      associate with each of the letters from A to Z.  Most of these letters will
      evaluate to the null set, but some of them will evaluate to a single digit.  Reading
      these non-null letters in ascending 1-to-9 order will provide you with the answer.
