      Pair the lyrics to their corresponding newspapers and figure out a way to use

    content: Once you've applied the historical dates as offsets to the words from
      the songs' lyrics and gotten a list of new words that match the superfluous
      portions of the dictionary definitions from the puzzle, sort your new words
      by the year of the historical event. Read the first letter of the words to get
      the answer.
