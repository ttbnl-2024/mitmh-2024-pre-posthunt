    keywords: Cerberus movement
    content: Each puzzle solution is unique, at least with respect to the first move
      played.  You will need to figure out how the Cerberus moves.  What does the
      flavor suggest it moves like (a subset of queen moves, limited range)?  There
      are additional aspects of the puzzle that may hint at the exact aspects of movement
      (the dog locations around "Friend" in the title, the triangle shape for the
      Cerberus piece).

      and either haven't figured out FEN is needed or don't know how it is used
    order: 50.0
    keywords: finished exercises, final exam
    content: There is a specific format that each exercise answer (rank) has to be
      to be valid for the final exam.  Have you looked at the section titles and noticed
      any patterns (FEN)?  The black king talking at the rank 8 exercise is also trying
      to tell you something about the format.  You may need to use google/wiki/etc.
      to learn more about the format.

    keywords: extraction, final exam, FEN
    content: With best play (defined for black as delaying mate as long as possible),
      there is a unique mate in 7 line (if your FEN is correct).  You are given the
      format for how the moves are written in standard algebraic notation (no space
      after the period following the move number, single space after white and black
      moves).  The move numbers 2-7 are all mapped to single letters, can you see
      which these are?

    order: 100.0
    keywords: extraction, final exam, triple letters
    content: 'Every triple letter should be at a location that is a letter in the
      algebraic notation (except # is M for Mate), with the triple letter being two
      numbers and an operation (check/+, capture/x).  Check rather naturally represents
      addition, while capture, which might naturally represent multiplication, is
      subtraction (subtract the lower number from the higher), as given in locations
      4 and 7 in the mapping.  You will get each number from 1 to 13 once, providing
      an ordering on the letters.'
