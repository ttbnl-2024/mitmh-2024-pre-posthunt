      the words in each rule to make a meaningful sentence?

      of the kind of permutation it may be talking about?

    keywords: allowable sequence
    content: This page (https://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fcarc-oriented5)
      gives a good introduction on what an allowable sequence is. Where do allowable
      sequences naturally arise from?

    description: Solvers need a stronger clue on what to do with the allowable sequence
    order: 60.0
    keywords: allowable sequence
    content: An allowable sequence naturally arises from a configuration of points
      on a plane. Each point is labelled with a number, and the positions of 4 of
      them are already given to you in the puzzle. Try to reconstruct the point configuration
      from the allowable sequence. Some properties of the point configuration can
      be read off from the allowable sequence. For example, as you go from one row
      to the next, you flip one or more blocks. Each block correspond to collinear
      points in that order, and all the blocks in a permutation correspond to parallel
      lines.
