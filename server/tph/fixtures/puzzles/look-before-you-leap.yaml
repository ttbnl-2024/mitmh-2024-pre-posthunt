    content: The strings of letters look kind of like words of some sort.  They're
      not anagrams (some of them, like "mntan", definitely are not anagrammable);
      could there be something missing?

    content: Each row in the grid can be filled with the letters that were removed
      from one of the frog species. It will take some work to figure out the correct
      ordering, but you'll know when you have it correct.

      title, flavor, and theme. What could the grid represent? Why would you be leaping
