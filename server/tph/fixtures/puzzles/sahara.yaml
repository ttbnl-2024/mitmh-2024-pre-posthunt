    description: Solvers don't know how to use graphic tees.
    order: 5.0
    keywords: tee, shirt, graphic
    content: Each graphic tee points to a specific class of natural numbers. The person
      wearing that shirt would only choose to bet on a number that belongs in that
      class.

    description: Solvers don't understand colors for chips, or are confused about
      why they are all $1.
    order: 10.0
    keywords: colors, chips, denominations
    content: While in other parts of the casino different colored chips indicate different
      denominations ($1, $5, $100), at the roulette table each player is given a different
      color so that the croupier can keep track of which bets are associated with
      a given player when they are all interspersed across the table.  When the player
      buys in, they tell the croupier what denomination they would like each chip
      to be worth.  In this case, each player starts with one hundred chips of their
      color, and each chip is worth $1.

    description: Solvers can't figure out which numbers are possible bets.
    order: 12.0
    keywords: numbers, bet, sequences
    content: The American roulette wheel has a 0 and 00 and then goes from 1 to 36.  We
      are told no player bet on 0 or 00. Each class of numbers has a different number
      of numbers which fall between 1 and 36, except for the green and orange. Those
      values constrain the range of potential bets for each player.

      wheel, or how many times they won.
    order: 15.0
    keywords: players, colors, number of spins, number of wins
    content: "It is important to understand how the roulette payout works.  In American\
      \ roulette, a \"straight bet\" (which these all are) covers a single number,\
      \ and pays $35 plus you keep the $1 you had originally bet.  So, you can consider\
      \ placing each bet as -$1 on their total, and each win as +$36 on their total.\r\
      \n\r\nIt is possible to set up and simultaneously solve 5 different equations\
      \ for the 5 statements about amounts received upon cashing out.  This uniquely\
      \ determines the number of spins of the wheel, the number of bets placed by\
      \ each player per spin, and how many wins each player had.  This can be done\
      \ through programming or calculating possible payouts for different numbers\
      \ of spins through a spreadsheet."

    description: Not sure where to start with logic
    order: 30.0
    keywords: green, orange, starting, logic
    content: One way to start would be to try to disambiguate the orange player from
      the green player based on what you've identified as the two possible number
      classes they might be betting from. Once you have identified which type of numbers
      they are betting, use the statement about which of their numbers won to identify
      the winning and non-winning numbers.  Work through the logic, keeping track
      of the numbers from 1 to 36, testing possibilities against the different constraints
      given and marking them as winners or non-winners.

    description: Solvers think it's Braille, but aren't getting letters that make
      sense.
    order: 100.0
    keywords: Braille, not working
    content: Once you've identified that using Braille on the chip positions on the
      table is relevant, consider the flavortext "from where you were standing," keeping
      in mind that the croupier stands on the opposite side of the table from the
      bettors.
