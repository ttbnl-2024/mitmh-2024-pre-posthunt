    description: Solvers have the grid filled and are working on extraction
    order: 100.0
    keywords: extraction, filled
    content: Each blank region needs to be filled by another unclued word (though
      enumeration is given).  Each of these words is missing one letter, either nondirectional
      or directional (in which case that movement in the grid is skipped).
