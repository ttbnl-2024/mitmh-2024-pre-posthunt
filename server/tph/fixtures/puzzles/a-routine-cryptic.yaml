    content: This puzzle's clues are cryptic clues. If you have never seen or solved
      cryptic clues before, a guide to cryptic clues, such as the one at https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/premium/xword/cryptics.html,
      will likely be helpful (And as with many mystery hunt puzzles, there is also
      something else going on).

    keywords: stuck, cryptic, clues
    content: If you are having difficulty solving the cryptic clues, it may not (just)
      be because they are difficult clues.  As with many mystery hunt puzzles, there
      is a twist, and in the case of this puzzle, the twist affects every clue.  If
      you have possible clue answers, but you can't quite make the wordplay fit, this
      is probably why.

      given the clue pointed at by the message, what kind of diamond would you be
      looking for?

    content: The Abbott and Costello movie "The Naughty Nineties" which is mentioned
      in the message from the extraneous wordplay letters in the Down clues, is most
      famous for one specific routine.  That routine is important for interpreting
      what you eventually get from the message from the letters from Across clues.

      have canonical numbers, what you need to extract the answer is the names of
      the positions.  No other baseball knowledge is helpful; however, remembering
      the type of puzzle this is will be.
