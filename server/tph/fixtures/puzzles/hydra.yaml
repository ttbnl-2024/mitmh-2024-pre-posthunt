      or maybe you would.  In any case, you are very unlikely to be able to solve
      this metapuzzle before you've opened the puzzles whose names start to repeat.

      that fork - the answers do too.  See if you can identify how the answer forking

    content: The answer forking between the two-puzzle/four-puzzle/eight-puzzle levels
      is associated with what the letters on either side of each answer.  Understanding
      what is happening with the eight-puzzle level involves understanding what could
      be on one side or the other of each answer, but this time it involves understanding
      words that could be on either side of the puzzle answer.

    content: For the four answers on one side of the two-answer-to-four-answer fork,
      the word which can be added to the answer goes before the answer; for the four
      answers on the other side of the two-answer-to-four-answer fork, the word which
      can be added goes after the answer.

      level can go on the left side or the right side of the answer, the words that
      are added are LEFT and RIGHT.
