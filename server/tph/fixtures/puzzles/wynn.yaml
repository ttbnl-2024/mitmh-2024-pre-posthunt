    answer: GIVE US A MELODY
    response: Congrats! You've got a good ear for music, why don't you show us your
      own vocal performance? Have X people in your team (where X is 5 unless your
      team size is less than 10, then X will be 2) sing a song together that has a
      global appeal, specifically one from the Billboard Global 200. Keep it PG, of
      course, and send your video to melody@mitmh2024.com!
