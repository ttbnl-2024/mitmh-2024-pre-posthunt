    description: The solver doesn't know what to do or how to get started
    order: 10.0
    keywords: getting started, start
    content: The first thing you need to do is to solve the clues.  Be aware that
      you will likely need between a considerable number of clue answers to start
      filling in the grid with confidence - likely at least half of them, by the author's
      estimation.  You may find it helpful to know the answers have been clued in
      alphabetical order regardless of length.

    description: The solvers have many/most of answers but are unsure how to proceed
    order: 20.0
    keywords: getting started, start, stuck, how to solve
    content: The list of clued words combines two word lists.  One list is a list
      containing the words which fit in the crisscross across and down in the usual
      way; the other list is a list of words which trace the paths indicated in the
      diagram by the heavy outlines.  It is up to the solver to figure out which words
      are from which list

    description: The solvers are having difficulty getting the criss-cross started
    order: 20.1
    keywords: getting started, start, stuck
    content: If you are having difficulty getting started on the crisscross, you may
      find it helpful to focus on the very long answers - there's a fifteen letter
      answer reading across in the upper half of the puzzle, for instance - or the
      very short ones, as all of the three-letter answers are criss-cross answers,
      rather than the ones which snake through the grid.

    content: Seven snaking parts of the completed grid are more important than the
      rest - and these parts of the grid have something visible in common.

    order: 50.1
    keywords: extraction, stuck
    content: There are seven snaking parts of the completed grid which are more important
      than the rest.  What they are - and what they look like - are hinted at by the
      puzzle's title.

      tails but are not sure what to do with them (1 of 2)
    order: 70.0
    keywords: extraction, stuck, ouroboros
    content: The seven snakes which are chasing their own tails are indeed significant.  If
      a snake was chasing its tail, how would it move?

      tails but are not sure what to do with them (2 of 2)
    order: 70.1
    keywords: extraction, stuck, ouroboros
    content: A snake chasing it's tail would move in a circle.  Obviously, the letters
      in these snakes can't move - they're locked in place.  But can the snakes themselves
      move?

      to do with the new snake words. (1 of 3)
    order: 80.0
    keywords: stuck, extraction, ouroboros
    content: You are correct that the ouroboros words need to become new words which
      start in a different place around their snaking loop.  (The +numbers given at
      the end of the puzzle are movement offsets for the snakes in ascending order,
      and you can use them to confirm you've identified the new words correctly.)
