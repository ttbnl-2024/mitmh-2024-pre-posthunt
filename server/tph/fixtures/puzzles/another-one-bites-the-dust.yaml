    content: The theme of this puzzle is "MASS EXTINCTION," which is a clue to 1)
      the ordering mechanic and 2) the types of animals referenced. Your first step
      should be to find the names of these animals. All are specific types of the
      animal listed, so - for example - the SPRINGBOK mentioned in the first bullet
      point is a specific type of SPRINGBOK. Use the clues given in each anecdote
      to determine the specific name.

    content: "The clue phrase, \"Ex-Tinct Ion\" (Or, \"EX [HYPHEN] TINCT ION\") must\
      \ reference something in the puzzle that you haven't used yet. \r\nA \"tinct\"\
      \ is a color - usually a lighter shade of a deeper color. Ions are charged molecules\
      \ that come in different types. \r\nSo an \"Ex-Tinct Ion\" would be an ion that\
      \ has had a color removed from it. \r\nTry seeing if you can find any anagrams\
      \ of color-ion combinations in the hitherto-unused information in each anecdote.\
      \ (Note: online anagram solvers don't often feature ion names in their word\
      \ lists)."

      \ As a reference to help you, notice the dollar amounts at the bottom of the\
      \ page, and remember that the theme of the puzzle is MASS extinctions, not just\
      \ \"Ex-Tinct Ions.\"\r\nThese numbers are the molar masses of the ions used\

    content: "The flavor text says that you should note the \"charges\" of the molar\
      \ masses. Ionic charges come in positive or negative. \r\nFor ions with positive\
      \ charges, index from the front of the color in the anagram. For ions with negative\
      \ charges, index from the end of the color in the anagram. \r\nSo, for example,\
      \ the anagram \"A LOCAL MINIMUM\" contains LILAC and AMMONIUM. The ammonium\
      \ ion has a +1 charge, so we index one letter from the front of LILAC, and pull\
      \ the L.\r\nThe next anagram, \"CABARET ROMANCE\" contains CREAM and CARBONATE.\
      \ The carbonate ion has a -2 charge, so we index two letters from the end of\
      \ CREAM, and pull the A."
