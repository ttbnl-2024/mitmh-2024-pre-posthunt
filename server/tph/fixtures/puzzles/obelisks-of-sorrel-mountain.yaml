      use that to extract the answer
    order: 90.5
    keywords: trail blaze, trailblazing
    content: Look for the symbol for "start", and then pretend that you're facing
      the blaze from the center of the hexagon. Then, either maintain your current
      orientation (straight) or rotate one side right or left before proceeding to
      the next hexagon and repeating the process until you reach the blaze for "end".
