    content: Ignore the letters at first. The black cells and numbers make a standard
      Akari puzzle. Some cells have lights which illuminate the cells in the same
      row and the cells in the same column up to the next black cell; you must locate
      those. Every cell must be illuminated; no cell containing a light can be illuminated
      by another light. The numbers tell how many lights are orthogonally adjacent.
      After you mark off the cells adjacent to the 0 clues, there is only one way
      to illuminate R2C7, which is by R1C7 having a light.

    content: After you've filled in some pretty easy steps, you may reach a point
      where the 1 clue in R6C5 has to have a light to its left or below, and the 3
      clue in R11C4 needs all its lights. But the cells above and to the right of
      this 3 would illuminate the only places for the 1's light, so only one of them
      can have a light; the other lights must go left of and below the 3, and there
      cannot be any other lights in this section of C4 and C5. You can apply the same
      sort of logic between this 3 and the 3 in R10C11. If it's too much for you,
      there are solvers for this puzzle type on the web.

    content: The letters in spaces with lights will tell you how to find an answer
      elsewhere. In the text adventure you should encounter a place that looks reminiscent
      of this grid's central theme. Make that place match.
