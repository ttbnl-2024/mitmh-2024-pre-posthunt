    content: The puzzle title references badges. You should have received badges in
      your team bag at kickoff and there should be obvious puzzly aspects to them.
      If you don't have badges, contact HQ.

    content: For the Ceres message, think of common series where the items start with
      the first letters on the badges. For Eris, you might be able to get some help
      from Sherlock Holmes. For Gonggong, it's a common code that uses dots and dashes.
      For Haumea, look for a Yankee Uniform in your Hotel. For Makemake, it's A Simple
      Code Identifying Information. For Orcus, try reading with your hands. Quaoar's
      code sounds like it was invented by an actor from Footloose. For Sedna, it's
      elementary.

    content: Notice that each badge talks about the god the dwarf planet is named
      after. If you go to the locations that are encoded on the badges, you will find
      posters that are (very loosely) themed after each of those gods. You need to
      get information from those posters somehow.
