    content: "One clue in each non-English language needs to be modified, since a\
      \ \u201Cfalse friend\u201D between that language and English has been replaced\
      \ with the translation of the corresponding English word. For example, 50D is\
      \ \"Jolle tog prostituerad p\xE5 kaffe, mj\xF6lk och t\xE5rta\", and answered\
      \ with EKA. The false friend is \"slut\", which has been re-translated to \"\
      prostituerad\". The rough translation is \"run out of... kaffe, mj\xF6lk och\
      \ t\xE5rta\", cluing the end letters."
