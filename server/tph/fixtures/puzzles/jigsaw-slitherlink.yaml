      the Slitherlink
    order: 50.0
    keywords: slitherlink
    content: 'Some parts of the jigsaw are fractals, but the rules of Slitherlink
      remain the same: draw a closed loop not passing through the interior of any
      square so that the numbers on each square indicate how much of the loop intersects
      with the square boundary. To be more precise, the closed loop is a Jordan curve
      (a continuous, non-self-intersecting closed loop), which does not have to go
      along the edges of some square, so long as it does not intersect the interior
      of any square.'

    description: Solvers have solved the Slitherlink, but stuck on extraction
    order: 90.0
    keywords: extraction
    content: A common extraction method for normal Slitherlinks is to count the number
      of squares in the indicated row/column that is inside the loop.
