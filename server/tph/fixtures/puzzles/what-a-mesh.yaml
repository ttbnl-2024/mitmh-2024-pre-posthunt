    content: These clues don't make sense in their current form; they feel like they
      are halves of two different clues welded together.

    order: 10.1
    keywords: getting started, start
    content: These "clues" don't match internally because they are actually composed
      of halves of two different clues which have been put back together to form new
      "clues" which don't make much sense.  Fortunately, the halves of each split
      clue have been swapped with each other, which will make it easier to put them
      back together correctly.

    order: 30.0
    keywords: clues
    content: The clues in this puzzle must be paired up, and they must swap halves
      between the pairs.  If you are having difficulty solving these clues, this may
      be why.  Once the ends of the paired clues have been swapped back to the proper
      starting halves, there should be no other obstacles to the solving the clues,
      and they should solve normally by the usual methods.

    content: Answers to the clues fall into two related categories.  One category
      can be viewed as down-to-earth (but isn't really); the other isn't down-to-earth
      at all.  One answer from each pair of clues belongs in each category.

    keywords: answers
    content: The clue answers fall broadly into two categories.  Answers in one of
      these categories consists mostly of plain English words, while answers in the
      other category consist mostly of proper nouns.  Searching for and identifying
      what these categories are should be more straightforward with this knowledge.

    keywords: answers
    content: There are two types of clue answers; one of them is "names (with 'moon')
      for specific types of full moon", while the other is "names of satellites within
      our solar system". One answer from each pair of clues belongs to each category.

    order: 70.0
    keywords: extraction
    content: One of the categories is the start of an ordered - and number-able set;
      the other isn't.  You will want to use the orderable category to order the paired
      answers before working out how to actually extract the answer.

    content: Order the paired answers to the clues by the moons - the first full moon
      of the lunar year first, the second full moon of the lunar year second, and
      so on.  Then take the first letter of the answer paired with the name of the
      first full moon, the second letter of the answer paired with the name of the
      second full moon, and so on.
