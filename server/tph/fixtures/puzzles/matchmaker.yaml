      of each type. Divide the symbols into 6 groups by type of symbol and whether
      they were crossed by a line. Each set is ordered in a different way: By left
      clues, by right clues, right-to-left, left-to-right, top-to-bottom, and bottom-to-top.
      Each phrase relates to a different puzzle in this round.'
