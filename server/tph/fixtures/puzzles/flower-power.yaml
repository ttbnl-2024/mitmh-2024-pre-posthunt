      puzzles with their clues mingled together

    keywords: getting started, start
    content: The reason every clockwise clue and counterclockwise clue has two clues,
      and that there are two diagrams provided with the puzzle, is because this puzzle
      contains two Crushed Petals with their clues combined.  You will need to work
      out which clues are part of each puzzle as part of the solution process.
