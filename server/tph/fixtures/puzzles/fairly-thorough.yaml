    content: The first thing to do is to make a map of everything here. You should
      get 55 locations.

    keywords: formula, map
    content: There are 3 directions, 3 maths at the bottom, and 3 sign colors. It
      seems like you can match these up.

    order: 25.0
    keywords: signs, match, colors
    content: The directions and math match the sign colors in red, white, blue order.
      You'll want to use the given directions to form a path between through the nodes
      of a particular color, though each direction may go for multiple nodes. You
      should have 13 red signs, 12 white signs, and 7 blue signs.

    order: 50.0
    keywords: mapped, matched, stuck
    content: To make sense of the math, you'll need to find what this is referring
      to. Do the overall "shape" of the map or sign colors remind you of something?

    keywords: map shape, identification
    content: This clickaround is actually a map of the major interstates of the US
      interstate system. The room sizes are an approximation of the population at
      the node. The numbers provide an ordering for something about each node.
