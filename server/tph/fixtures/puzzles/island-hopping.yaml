    description: The solvers do not know what a nurikabe is or are having trouble
      solving it
    order: 10.0
    keywords: getting started, start, nurikabe
    content: The puzzle type with the numbers in the grid is called "Nurikabe".  Rules
      are available if you follow the puzz.link link for interactive solving, or you
      can google for them.  The puzzle solve for this nurikabe puzzle gets noticeably
      more difficult past the halfway point. If you get stuck at this point, be advised
      that online solvers exist for this type of puzzle; the constructor used https://semiexp.net/games/cspuz-solver2/index.html
      to verify uniqueness.

      with the listed words
    order: 50.0
    keywords: stuck, criss-cross
    content: The flavortext mentions criss-crossing; the reasonable inference from
      this - that the Nurikabe grid is a diagramless criss-cross with the given wordlist,
      is correct.

    description: The solvers have solved the Nurikabe, and know that they want to
      place the words in the Nurikabe grid in a criss-cross, but don't know how.
    order: 50.1
    keywords: stuck, criss-cross
    content: The numbers following each criss-cross word/phrase correspond to the
      size of islands crossed by the correctly placed words. They are given in ascending
      order; it is up to solvers to identify the actual order the islands are crossed.  Some
      of the numbers are larger than the largest island size;  this is because some
      words cross multiple adjacent island grid cells, and when this happens, the
      size of the island is added to the total for each of the adjacent grid cells.  (In
      other words, a word which crossed 6 adjacent grid cells in a size 7 island would
      have 42 in its number list, not 7).

    order: 90.1
    keywords: stuck, extraction
    content: A small number of Nurikabe clue cells have Criss-Cross letters on them.  Read
      them in ascending order of island size. There should only be one letter for
      each size number.
