    content: "The descriptions here deliberately misinterpret the titles of historical\
      \ markers of often-questionable significance. For example, the first story,\
      \ about a jogger who happens to trip and surprisingly ends up drilling an oil\
      \ well is a marker called ACCIDENTAL OIL WELL (https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=98224).\r\
      \nYou'll note that numerous words and phrases from the actual marker are included\
      \ in the incorrect description, including: (the town of) Newcastle, (county\
      \ of) Weston, \"an old Maytag washing machine,\" and \"died in 2005 at the age\
      \ of 90.\" Find similar salient words or phrases in the other descriptions to\
      \ identify the markers in question. The markers are listed in alphabetical order\
      \ by title."

    description: Solvers are stuck on extraction
    order: 4.0
    keywords: extract, extraction
    content: In each erroneous description, you'll notice a single number that has
      been spelled out, as opposed to being written numerically. Use these numbers
      to index by word (per the flavor text, "Mark my words...") into the text (not
      including title) of the historical marker in question. So, for example, the
      ersatz description of the first marker chronologically (Woodstock, 1636) references
      "its thirty-eight performers." The 38th word of the actual Woodstock marker
      is FIRST. The second marker (Iron Letters on the Church, 1699) contains the
      word "twelve," and the 12th word of the actual marker is LETTERS. These together
      spell "FIRST LETTERS," indicating the first letters of the remaining words will
      spell out the answer.
