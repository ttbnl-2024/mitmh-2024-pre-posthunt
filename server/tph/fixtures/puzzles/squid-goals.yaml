      should ordinarily be expected to be?  And can you think of a five-word maxim
      that this title could be interpreted as defying by way of this difference between
      the "expected" title and the actual title?

    content: This puzzle's title seems awfully close to the popular idiom of "Squad
      Goals."  Can you think of a five-word maxim that this this title change could
      be an example of defying?  And how might that impact the answers to the cryptic
      clues?

    keywords: stuck, aha
    content: This puzzle's title, "Squad Goals", is an example of a word phrase that
      defies the maxim "There is no I in 'Team'" by taking a team ("Squad") and putting
      an I in it (to make it "Squid").  All of the answers to the cryptic clues in
      this puzzle are names of sports teams, and the wordplay in the cryptic clues
      follows a similar pattern.

    content: This puzzle's title, "Squad Goals", is an example of a word phrase that
      defies the maxim that "There is no I in 'Team'" by taking a team ("Squad") and
      putting an I in it (to make it "Squid"). All of the answers to the cryptic clues
      in this puzzle are names of sports teams; the wordplay for each clue defies
      the maxim that "There is no I in 'Team'" by likewise replacing one letter of
      a team's name with an I.  (The straight definition defines the team's actual
      name, as you would expect, though not as the name of the team.)
