      to city name changes.
    order: 10.0
    keywords: cities, clues
    content: There are many more clues than pictures of cities - why might that be?
      The first clue is a good place to start when looking for what these cities have
      in common.

    content: Many of the first few clues have the word "today", and the clues are
      not listed in alphabetical order. Think about why that is.

    description: Solvers are very stuck on extraction and want the strongest hint.
    order: 100.2
    keywords: wrong time, wrong order, extraction, index, stuck
    content: You can form a chain by associating the clues that are out of time with
      the city that should be there instead, with Tsaritsyn placed last as instructed.
      That will give you the ordering. Index the number of name changes (not total
      names) into the out-of-time city name.
