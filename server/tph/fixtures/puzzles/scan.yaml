      large numbers consisting of 0s and 1s?

    order: 1.1
    keywords: starting,beginning
    content: The multiplication indicates that, despite having only 0s and 1s, these
      numbers are in decimal, not binary.

    order: 2.0
    keywords: large number,factorize
    content: The bulk of this puzzle is a programming challenge. You already know
      from the example that the huge numbers are products of two QR codes written
      as decimal numbers consisting of 0s and 1s. Find an algorithm that can exploit
      this constraint to factorize the numbers.

    order: 3.0
    keywords: algorithm,programming,factorize
    content: "As is often the case in programming, there\u2019s more than one way\
      \ of doing it. However, the gist of the intended insight is that the product\
      \ of the last (least significant) n digits of two factors is equal to the last\
      \ n digits of the product. For example, since 23\xD771 = 1633, any two numbers\
      \ that end in 23 and 71 will multiply to a product that ends in 33."
