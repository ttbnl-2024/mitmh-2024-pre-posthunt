    description: Solvers have roughly figured out how to solve the Sokoban, but not
      computed the number of moves.
    order: 30.0
    keywords: solvable, exponential
    content: Don't be afraid and compute the number of moves required to solve it!
      The "debug" at the bottom of the source code tells you how many moves it takes
      to reach certain checkpoints, which will make it easier to debug your computation.
