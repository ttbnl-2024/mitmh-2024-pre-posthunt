      are there, and what could you do with these and the numbers?

    content: "The given stars are the constellation Vulpecula, as it is in the night\
      \ sky. The motion of stars over time is described with the \"proper motion\"\
      , which is found in the Gaia archive in units of milliarcseconds / yr. The decoded\
      \ 19-digit strings gives us a new Gaia object, with its own proper motion. Gaia\
      \ tells us that the stars don't move with their own proper motion, and instead\
      \ move with their associated object's proper motion.\r\n\r\nWhen you move the\
      \ Vulpecula stars to the right location (within ~10 pixels), the interactive\
      \ component will indicate that you did it correctly. You may need to jiggle\
      \ the stars slightly to get the checker to respond."

    content: The stars in Columba have Greek letter designations (e.g., Beta Columba).
      Index by the position of the Greek letter in the Greek alphabet into the answer
      for the Vulpecula star. Gaia / Alpha Columba should be treated differently,
      by taking its name (Phact). The reading order by ending star is across the top,
      then the lone star at the bottom -- or, [Delta Col, Kappa Col, Gamma Col, Beta
      Col, Alpha Col, Epsilon Col, Eta Col].
