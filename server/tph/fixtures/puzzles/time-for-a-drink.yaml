    content: Your task is to use this secret subway system to get from Janus' hotel
      (Station A) at 3:00 PM to the Battery (Station S) and back by 6:00 PM. You can
      switch trains instantaneously if needed, or you may have to wait on a platform
      for the next train. It's essentially a maze. Only one set of trains will get
      you there and back again in time, and you may have to utilize express trains
      that go past your intended destination, and then backtrack using a local train
      or a different line entirely.

    content: You won't take the first train from Station A (the southbound Gray local).
      Instead, wait for the 3:05 PM southbound Gray express to Station H, and then
      backtrack to Station C using the northbound Gray local . You should be able
      to get to Station S by 4:25 PM, and then depart Station S using the 4:30 PM
      northbound Purple local. You will use all seven lines on the way down and on
      the way back, though not all stations will be used.

      \ the following:\r\n- The emblem of a pair of crossed keys at the bottom of\

      \ pin featuring two gold keys, given to him by his boss, the concierge, who\

    content: 'As specified in the flavor text, each station only serves hotels "within
      1 block (uptown or crosstown)" of the station. By mapping the New York Les Clefs
      d''Or hotels, you''ll have a good idea of which hotels are served by which stations,
      except in the crowded Midtown North area. There, pay attention to the listed
      avenues for each location: 6th Ave., for example, is too far west to serve The
      Pierre, but serves five hotels, which must mean it is located at 6th Avenue
      and Central Park South, serving The Essex, Ritz-Carlton Central Park, Park Lane,
      The Plaza, and 1 Hotel (whose address may be listed incorrectly on the Les Clefs
      d''Or website despite our alerting the organization to the error). The other
      hotels should be easy to place based on this information.'

      \ the correct hotels before they can complete this step]\r\nThe boldfaced lines\
      \ on the message board notes refer to letters to pull when you have reached\

      \ you will only use notes from stations at which you change trains; notes regarding\
      \ stations you pass without changing trains go unused.\r\nSome notes mention\
      \ specific conditions, such as only being available before or after a certain\
      \ time. These notes are only used if the conditions are met. \r\nFor example,\
      \ one note's bolded text says, \"For the second time only when you visit the\
      \ Midtown: Madison Avenue Station [take letter] eight from our \"intimate salon\"\
      . The \"intimate salon\" referenced is called Rarities (at the Lotte New York\
      \ Palace), so on our second visit to this station, we would pull the S. However,\
