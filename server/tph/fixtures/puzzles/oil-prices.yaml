    description: Solvers don't recognize these processes imply redox equations.
    order: 10.0
    keywords: Theme, starting
    content: Each of the production methods involves a reduction-oxidation (redox)
      reaction which can be described with an equation.

    description: Solvers don't know what to do with the redox equations.
    order: 20.0
    keywords: solving equation
    content: The mnemonic "OILRIG," which stands for "Oxidation is loss, reduction
      is gain (referring to the transfer of electrons)" is hinted in the flavortext
      along with an instruction to "reduce" the prices.  Thus, you'll need to determine
      which element is reduced in each equation. There are online tools which will
      do this for you.

    description: Solvers don't know what to do with the reduced elements they've found.
    order: 25.0
    keywords: element, price reduction
    content: Each price should be reduced by an amount equal to the value of the atomic
      number of the reduced element from that production method.

    description: Solvers don't see the final answer after making price reductions.
    order: 30.0
    keywords: final answer, extraction
    content: The "reduced price" (obtained by subtracting the atomic number of the
      reduced element from the original price) results in a number which can be used
      to index into the reduced element.
