    order: 25.0
    keywords: verification, uniqueness, ambiguity
    content: Many logical deductions can be made about piece assignments.  Trying
      to create a position by playing from the start can also help with your intuition.

    order: 50.0
    keywords: extraction, partial
    content: 'You extract from the origin square of the last move.  For the file,
      ask: what piece starts (on rank 1) on this file?  The pawns spell out a function
      that takes the rank as a parameter and is applied to a letter derived from the
      file (case does not matter), for one letter per diagram.'

    order: 75.0
    keywords: partial, 960
    content: The partial NINELX and the response ("room 518") indicate chess 960,
      where the room numbers are the setups as in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer_random_chess_numbering_scheme
      and 518 is standard chess.  How does this change what is either newly possible
      or no longer possible?

    order: 100.0
    keywords: 960, extraction
    content: Nothing from the standard chess solutions is required to extract the
      answer, but the mechanism is identical.  Make sure to check the pawn assignments
      (for the 6 boards combined) and the piece setups (for each board), along with
      your solutions for the diagrams.

      were all in room 518 at the time of the crime."'
