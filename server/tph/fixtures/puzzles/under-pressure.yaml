    description: Solvers are stuck at the very beginning and have no idea what to
      do
    order: 0.0
    keywords: stuck, beginning
    content: Each math operation represents a different operation on words.  The examples
      at the top show that + is concatenation, for instance.  Use the examples to
      figure out the remainder of the operations (-, *, numbers).

    description: Solvers have finished Part 1 but have no ideas about what to do with
      Part 2
    order: 60.0
    keywords: part2, proof, stuck
    content: The first Problem of Part 2 is the easiest.  Try to find a phrase using
      two of the words from Problem 1 that relates to the third word.  Exactly what
      did you have to do to the former two words to make it relate to the third?  Think
      of what you learned in Part 1.

    description: Solvers have found some relationships amongst words in Part 2, but
      haven't realized they're all names of theorems/formulas/etc.
    order: 80.0
    keywords: part2
    content: For each problem in Part 2, you need to find a way in which all the input
      words (the y_ij words) all relate, using things you learned from Part 1.  Any
      intermediate words are clued by the lemmas and "equating both sides" clues.  Once
      you've found a relationship (the first problem is easiest), write it out mathematically.

      realized they're names of theorems/formulas/etc. yet
    order: 100.0
    keywords: part2, extraction
    content: Each problem in Part 2 asks you to prove a theorem, and for each you
      find a mathematical equation that relates the input (y_ij) words.  What are
      the names of these theorems (or formula, or transformation, or ...)?  The lengths
      (of their first words) should match the "check your answers" lengths.  Then
      index into the names to get the answer.

    answer: CREATE EQUATION FOR YOUR TEAMS HANDLE
    response: Send us an equation that evaluates to your team name. You can make up
      new operations if you want.
