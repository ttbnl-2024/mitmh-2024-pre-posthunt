    content: The flavortext talks about two sides in "tendril-to-limb" combat.  What
      non-mythical combatants, which are plausibly appropriate for each of Persephone's
      six-month periods of residency, might be facing off versus each other here?

    content: If you have answers for half or more of this meta's feeder puzzles, you
      may have noticed that some of the answers are too long to fit in the provided
      grid.  Are there any parts of the answers which you might consider squeezing
      into a single grid cell?

    content: If you examine your answers closely, you may find things associated with
      one side or the other's combatants; placing these items into a single grid cell
      will allow all feeder puzzle answers, including the answers which are otherwise
      too long, to fit within the provided grid.

    order: 30.0
    keywords: Too many answers, fitting answers into grid
    content: There are twice as many answers as there are rows in the grid, which
      means that you can't place the answers in the grid without the answers being
      in conflict with each other.  This is because the answers **are** in conflict
      with each other.  In each row, you will have two "conflicting" answers, just
      as the flavortext describes it.

    keywords: extraction
    content: Once you have the warring answers entered into the grid in the appropriate
      month order and direction, there will be a letter from the other answer in every
      grid cell with a plant part, and there will also be a letter from the other
      answer in every grid cell with an RIP inscription.  The extraction uses these
      letters from the other answers.

    content: Read the letters from the other answer, in the cells with the plant parts
      and RIP inscriptions, in Spring-Summer-Fall-Winter order - that is, chronologically
      from March to February.  For each month, take the letter from the other answer,
      not the answer associated from that month - that is, take the letters from the
      squares with the plant parts for the spring and summer months, and letters associated
      with the RIP inscriptions for the fall and winter months.
