    content: Ezekiel's spiritual music is pretty dry, huh? Maybe finding his song
      can give you some inspiration. I can feel it in my bones.

    content: Your mind clears for a moment as the music starts over, the yogi scrutinizing
      everybody's form. "'Out-of-corpus' is oddly phrased," you say to yourself. "Perhaps
      that can put an idea in my head..."

    content: If you have recognized the song, much should fall into place. To break
      out of the yoga trap, you'll have to find a way to reconnect the disjointed
      parts of your inner self with the few words available in your entranced state.
      With luck (and a bit of elbow grease), you'll feel like a new person when you're
      done.

      in mind as you look at your meta answers and "put yourself together." This is
      a puzzle about anatomical etymology and the reference to Yogi Ezekiel is a hint
      at the song "Dem Bones."

    content: 'Each meta answer has two parts: one part that hints at the etymology
      of a single bone. Using the song "Dem Bones" (as hinted by "Yogi Ezekiel) and
      the yoga pose from the flavor, you should be able to chain together the bones
      by forming a toe-to-head chain with the meta answers. The other half of each
      answer can be laid over the bone from the previous answer to extract.'
