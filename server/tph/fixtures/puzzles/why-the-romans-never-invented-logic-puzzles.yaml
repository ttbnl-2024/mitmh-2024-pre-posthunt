      the rules of the logic puzzle

    keywords: stuck, beginning, rules
    content: The example grids teach you the rules of this variant logic puzzle.  The
      I, V, and X in each row and column need to be dividable into legit Roman numerals
      satisfying a property defined by the number for that row/column.  For example
      IVII might divide as IV then II, or it might divide as I then VII, etc.  No
      Roman numeral (segment a row/column is divided into) can occur more than once
      in an entry.

    description: Solvers approximately know the rules of the puzzle, but are stuck
      on the logic puzzle part itself
    order: 50.0
    keywords: logic, hard
    content: "To be unambiguous, the full rules of the puzzle are:\r\n-- Enter the\
      \ letters I, V, X in the grid.\r\n-- Each row/column must be dividable into\
      \ any number (including 1) of legit Roman numerals (e.g IX is ok but IIX is\
      \ not), each <=39 (equivalent to only using I, V, and X) such that the product\
      \ of those numbers equals the entry in the row/column.  1 is allowed.\r\n--\
      \ No entry can have the same factor more than once (including 1).\r\n\r\nTips:\r\
      \n-- There needn't be an unambiguous way to divide a row/column into Roman numerals.\
      \  e.g., if 20=XIII, that could be X*II*I or X*I*II - the entry in the grid is\
      \ the same.\r\n-- Approach each corner separately, generally starting with the\
      \ shorter entries and smaller products.\r\n-- Look for numbers that have relatively\
      \ few factorizations, especially with repeated prime factors (98=2*7^2, 32=2^5,\
      \ etc.).  Because factors cannot be repeated, these are usually quite forced.\r\
      \n-- If you can identify the lone I in an entry, the remainder becomes much\
      \ more forced."

    description: Solvers have completed the grid but are stuck on extraction
    order: 100.0
    keywords: extraction
    content: Like in the example puzzle read the letters corresponding to the Vs in
      the grid.  You are asked to "reparse" two strings to get an answer of length
      9.  "Reparsing" means re-dividing a sequence of I, V, and X into legit Roman
      numerals, just like you did in the logic puzzle.
