      \ substandard tools. You'll have to make the best of it! \r\nAccording to Crassus,\
      \ you need to book flights on icarusaway.com. Have you visited that site and\
      \ looked around? \r\nYou are also provided with two sets of photos. The first\
      \ is apparently a set of flight itinerary details (Crassus says they represent\
      \ destinations, but may be cities, airports, or nearby landmarks). The second\
      \ is a set of \"Tell-a-Phony\" confirmations of real flights by real airlines.\
      \ Try to identify these photos."

    order: 2.0
    keywords: pictures, photos, destinations, Pictoristan
    content: Each photo represents a destination for a domestic flight in the itinerary.
      The photos are shown in alphabetical order. For example, the first photo shows
      the BARCELONA (Spain) soccer team, but clues an arrival city of BARCELONA, Venezuela.
      The second photo is of the BRANDENBURG Gate, but clues BRANDENBURG airport in
      Berlin, Germany. Each location will be added to one of the destination spots
      in your inventory that has the correct number of blanks.

      \ By looking up these call signs and cross-checking them with the airline's\
