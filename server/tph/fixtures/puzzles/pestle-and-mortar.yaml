    keywords: sentences, predictions

    description: Solvers have identified the fortune cookie phrases and most of the
      words from the sentences, but haven't realized what transformations to apply
      or that that they transform into sets
    order: 70.0
    keywords: sentence, words, transformation
    content: Each of the strange sentences (at the bottom, not the fortune cookies)
      gives 3 words.  These 3 words must be transformed using the same transformations
      as were applied to the phrases suggested by the fortunes.  The 3 words for each
      sentence will all become members of a set (different set per sentence) when
      the correct transformations are applied (one transformation per word).

    description: Solvers have correctly transformed most of the words, but haven't
      realized they correspond with forms of divination yet
    order: 100.0
    keywords: transformed, words, set
    content: After applying the appropriate transformations, the 3 words from each
      sentence form members of a set (a different set per sentence).  Each of these
      sets relates to a different way to predict the future.
