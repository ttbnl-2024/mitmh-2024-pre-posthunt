    description: Solvers are stuck on getting started with the logic puzzle
    order: 0.0
    keywords: begin, start
    content: This is a shading logic puzzle with a constraint present in each cell.
      Each letter stands for a particular constraint. As it states in the flavortext,
      one cell in each row is not satisfied. The best way to get started is to try
      to figure out what the constraints are for each letter. For example, you might
      pay attention to when Q becomes unsatisfied.

    keywords: what are hamming codes
    content: The HAMMING CODES the cluephrase is referring to are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code.
      We're working with a Hamming(15, 11) code. "each row has an error" is true here
      as well.

    keywords: parity matrix
    content: This refers to a parity matrix (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity-check_matrix).
      However, we're not working with the Hamming code anymore -- the shading defines
      a parity matrix by itself.
