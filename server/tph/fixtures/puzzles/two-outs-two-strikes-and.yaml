    description: Solvers are stuck on getting started
    order: 1.0
    keywords: start, begin
    content: Each line is a fragment of a sentence. They go together in sets of three,
      but once you have put them together, you'll notice that something specific seems
      to be missing from each.

    content: "Each sentence describes a male animal, and each sentence has had two\
      \ o's cut out of it. Those o's represent something specific. \r\nThe title references\
      \ a worst-case scenario in baseball: two outs, two strikes, and no balls. \r\
      \nThese male animals have, alas, been castrated, so we'd refer to them by different\
      \ terminology."

    description: Solvers understand the "balls" have been removed, but think the solution
      is to find the female names of the animals.
    order: 2.1
    keywords: female
    content: When a male animal has had its two balls removed, it does not become
      a female. It becomes castrated. Many castrated adult animals have specific names
      that are neither the names for the adult male or adult female of their species.
      You'll need to use those names.
