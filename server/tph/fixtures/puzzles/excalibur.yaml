    content: Have you tried looking up some of the "stars in order of appearance"?
      Ignoring some of the numbers (especially the ordinals) might help. The flavour
      text is dancing around what this puzzle is about, but there are some clues in
      there.

    order: 2.0
    keywords: contra-dances
    content: There is a strong star theming in this puzzle. Look up what a star is
      in the context of contra-dance in general and specifically in the dances listed.
      The added words to the dance names should tell you what to look for. Note the
      directionality.

    description: Solvers don't know which component of the dance to use (strong hint)
    order: 2.5
    keywords: stars, dances
    content: Each dance listed here contains at least one "star"- a move in which
      dancers join hands at the center and walk in a circle, like a wheel turning
      around an axel. Each dance has a numerical modifier added to the name that indicates
      which star in that dance to use. You are looking for the handedness of that
      that star.

    order: 3.0
    keywords: left-handed, right-handed
    content: Map the list of dance stars to the graph by following the arrows, beginning
      at red. Then you want to consider the left-handed stars and the right-handed
      stars separate. The BLANK in the BLANK statement tells you what image you'll
      be able to make.
