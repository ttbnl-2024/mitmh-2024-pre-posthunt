    content: 'There are 27 cards, each of which have can be categorized into 3 different
      "values" along 3 different axes. You lose when you form a Set: when you have
      3 cards which, for each axis, are all the same or all different.'

    keywords: game is hard, how to win
    content: The bot's pretty good, but plays fairly. There does exist a winning line,
      you'll just have to find it. You might consider writing some code if you're
      not interested in brute-forcing every possible sequence.

    order: 80.0
    keywords: win, extraction
    content: Think back to the end of each game, where the cards both revealed their
      backing and 3 numbers between 0 and 2, as well as the alignment along each axis.

    description: Solvers are still stuck on extraction
    order: 100.0
    keywords: extraction
    content: The extraction is ternary. The colors give RGB order, and the numbers
      tell you which end of the axis is 0, 1, or 2.
