    order: 3.0
    keywords: trail, off-trail, bushwhack
    content: Each hole of the course will be visited only once, and they are always
      traversed along the path from the tee to the hole.  Any references to being
      "off-trail" or "bushwhacking" are when navigating from the hole from the previous
      step to the tee for the next step.

    description: Solvers are having trouble following the topographic maps.
    order: 5.0
    keywords: maps, elevation, topographic
    content: Applying some logic will help if you find following the directions tricky.  Each
      statement refers to a different one of the 18 holes. Try looking ahead to see
      if there are holes you can identify just using the description, without needing
      the information about direction or elevation change. Then you can work forwards/backwards
      from those spots, as well as knowing that those holes can be ruled out as possibilities
      for other statements.

    keywords: par, birdie, bogey, eagle, buzzard, grouse
    content: The specific index is determined by using the number given as par for
      the hole, and adjusting it by the number of strokes indicated by the wildlife
      spotted (if any).
