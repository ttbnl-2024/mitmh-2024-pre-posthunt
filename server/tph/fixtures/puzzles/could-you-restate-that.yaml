    content: If you compare the words listed at the bottom of the puzzle with the
      enumerations provided for the questions, you will discover that the lengths
      of the words in the list (collectively) match the lengths of the enumerated
      words (collectively).  As this suggests, you can use the words in the word list
      to make the questions which are responded to.  (They may not sound like sensible
      questions, but you should be able to make a question for each response with
      no words left over.)

    content: You will get two (or in a few cases, three) words from treating the words
      in each question as anguished English and looking for approximate homophones.  Each
      question's sound-alikes will contain a proper name, as well part of another
      kind of name, as alluded to elsewhere.

    content: The homonyms contain part of a state nickname - or in a few cases, parts
      of two state nicknames - as well as some familiar historical last names.  Some
      of the last names are those of US Presidents, and some aren't (but could have
      been).  What importance would states have to people who would be running for
      president?

    keywords: state, president, presidential, candidate
    content: The names which can be extracted phonetically from the questions are
      the names of candidates for the office of US president.  Some of these candidates
      never became president; what these candidates have in common is actually that
      they all lost a presidential election.  How might US states (which can be identified
      by extracting their nicknames phonetically) be important in regards to a presidential
      election campaign?

    content: The names which can be extracted phonetically from the questions are
      the names of candidates for the office of US president who lost an election.
      (Some of them also won a presidential election, of course.)  While these losing
      candidates may have received electoral college votes from all over the US, for
      the purposes of this puzzle, we are only concerned with the electoral college
      votes for these candidates from one or two states, which are identified by state
      nickname.

    content: For each question, you have a losing presidential election candidate.  For
      each candidate, you also have a specific election as well as a number of electoral
      college votes won from a specific state, or pair of states.  One of these data
      points is used for sorting, and the other is used for letter extraction.
