    content: This puzzle is all about bad translation from Latin into English, using
      Google Translate. For example, "Itineratum de Urbes Universum" translates to
      "List of Universe Cities," when the puzzle's author was trying to make a "list
      of universities." Using Google Translate on all of the Latin phrases in the
      puzzle is a good place to begin.

    order: 1.5
    keywords: seal, shape, shapes, balloon, bubble
    content: 'The bad translation has extended to the puzzle''s design: clearly, the
      author intended for each item to show a picture of the university''s seal (as
      in, its official emblematic seal), but instead used a picture of a seal (as
      in, the marine animal). However, the visual representation of the word balloon
      reflects the silhouette of the seal of the correct university, which can be
      used to confirm you have made a correct identification. (Note: be sure you''re
      looking at the university''s "official seal," and not -- for example -- its
      marketing "logo" or its athletic "symbol".)'
