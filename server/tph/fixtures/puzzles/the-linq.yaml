      the base game plus the swift start pack, no expansions)

    description: The solvers are having trouble with the logic puzzle; some early
      help hint
    order: 20.0
    keywords: logic puzzle
    content: Start with clue 2, which means you only have 1 hawk. Also, clue 6 gives
      you a bird, and clue 7 gives its position. Clue 12 names another bird, and its
      location can be deduced by combining clues 11 and 16. Continue working back
      and forth between the clues and the board to fill in the rest.

      row 2
    order: 40.0
    keywords: Hard, wording, logic, row 2, second row, middle row
    content: Many clues from earlier can help eliminate birds now. Most birds can't
      eat fish (clue 6), cannot have a color in their name (clue 5), can't nest in
      platforms (clue 7), etc. Also, note specificity - "immediately beside" means
      "adjacent," and "birds" means "definitely plural," while "the bird" means "definitely
      singular."

    order: 50.0
    keywords: extraction
    content: Note that birds in different habitats communicate differently - the forest
      birds are always looking for food, the field birds like to count their eggs
      before they hatch, and the wetlands birds hold their cards close to their chests.
