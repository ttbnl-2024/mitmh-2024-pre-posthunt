    content: "<<Depending on which game(s) they're stuck on, here are some likely\
      \ hints:>>\r\n\r\nAnt Dueler: The easiest path is probably going all the way\
      \ to the right before going down. If a stream of bullets is aimed directly at\
      \ you, you can move very slowly and still dodge all of them. If all else fails,\
      \ it's possible, though a bit harder, to solve the puzzle without beating all\
      \ 5 games.\r\n\r\nAre We Necro or Are We Dancer, level 2 passcode: No, you're\
      \ not missing a piece of paper (assuming you found all 3, including the one\
      \ that's only hinting the rhythm and not related to the passcode.) Think stupid.\r\
      \n\r\nOnly Humans Will Survive: Troll enemy: Whenever you press the R key, the\
      \ game restarts. Can you somehow solve the captcha without pressing your R key?\r\

    content: When you beat each game, you'll be greeted with a message containing
      one EMPHASIZED word, as well as one other bit of info that should help with
      extraction. You don't have to reorder the factors.

    keywords: extraction
    content: Five games, five emphasized words pointing to a specific Interpretation,
      and five numbers with a specific relationship to each other should point you
      in the direction of a fairly common (by Mystery Hunt standards) encoding to
      apply nine times.

    description: Solvers have the Berlin Interpretation table filled out, but are
      not sure about Complexity and Modality.
    order: 99.1
    keywords: Berlin Interpretation, unsure, check work
    content: Complexity is unfortunately hard to convey in a small game. We've done
      our best with complicated rules that need a long explanation guide. In regards
      to the modality of Are We Necro or Are We Dancer, think about how you entered
      the passcode.
