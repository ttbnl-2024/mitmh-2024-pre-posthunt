    description: Solvers have solved the spiral and identified the significance of
      RNA, but are unsure what to do next,.
    order: 70.0
    keywords: extraction, stuck, rna, dna
    content: While RNA has one strand instead of two, like DNA does, it nevertheless
      does have its own version of the adenine-thymine and cytosine-guanine pairings,
      which come into play in the processes where RNA is used to produce DNA, as well
      as in the production of proteins.  This is important for the sake of extraction.  It
      also helps to know how codons work in RNA/DNA, and what the standard abbreviations
      for them are.
