    order: 50.0
    keywords: virgin, virgins, weird al
    content: The virgins (left half of each meme) each represent members of a set
      that is similar to but distinct from the set represented by the Chads (right
      half of each meme).  A substring of the flavortext suggests where the descriptions
      of the virgins come from.

      in meme order.
