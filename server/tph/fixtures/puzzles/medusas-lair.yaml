      placing them in the grid.
    order: 5.0
    keywords: fill, punctuation, space
    content: You've already noticed that your answers contain "/" characters. Each
      answer should be entered into the grid from a snake head to a snake tail, including
      "/" characters, but not including any other punctuation or any spaces. The light
      grey squares will be left blank.

    description: Solvers are stuck on interpreting Perseus's observations.
    order: 75.0
    keywords: question mark, extract, Perseus, peered
    content: Each time Perseus peered into Medusa's lair, he positioned himself just
      outside the square grid, facing orthogonally inward. He recorded the cells he
      saw, in order from closest to farthest. For each cell, if it didn't contain
      a letter, he wrote a blank; if it did contain a letter, he wrote a "?" or a
      number. The light gray squares in the grid do not block lines of sight. It's
      up to you to figure out where Perseus stood each time.

    description: Solvers have not realized that the slashes are mirrors.
    order: 80.0
    keywords: question mark, extract, Perseus, peered
    content: Since Medusa's lair is 9x9, it might seem like Perseus should only have
      recorded 9 symbols for each observation. Yet, he saw more than 9 cells every
      time. So, he must have used something that alters how he saw the grid. It might
      help to read the myth of Perseus and Medusa.
