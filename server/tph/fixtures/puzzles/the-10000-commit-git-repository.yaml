    content: This puzzle is exactly what it says it is! You can use `git log` to see
      that the commits are out of order, both in terms of the ordinal number in the
      README file, and in terms of the timestamp. Your task is to create a repository
      that has them in the correct order.

    order: 50.0
    keywords: ''
    content: One interesting thing about git is that commit hashes are deterministic.
      That is, commits with the exact same details will have exactly the same hash.
      The puzzle tells you all the information that goes into a commit hash (along
      with the parent commit), so you'll need to figure out how to set those. You
      can use the hash given in the puzzle to check that you're doing the first commit
      correctly.
