    description: Solvers are stuck at the very start and haven't identified any/many
      of the ways frame words clue tiles
    order: 0.0
    keywords: stuck, start
    content: This puzzle references the board/card game "So Clover!".  As in that
      game, for each set you need to place 4 of the tiles in the frame such that along
      each frame edge the 2 tile words relate to the single word on the frame.  Unlike
      in "So Clover!" the relationships aren't "whatever goes"; instead each color
      represents a different way in which the frame word clues two tile words.

    content: "Each color has a different meaning, a different way in which the frame\
      \ word matches with two tile words.  A few hints:\r\nGreen: Phrases.\r\nPurple:\
      \ A form of wordplay that changes the two tile words.\r\nAqua: A different form\
      \ of wordplay that changes the two tile words.\r\nBlue: The tile words are unchanged,\
      \ but the frame word is slightly off."

    description: Solvers have formed all 8 clovers but haven't found that after rotating
      their leaves 180 degrees they form new clovers using diagonal words
    order: 40.0
    keywords: rotate, tile
    content: Now that each clover is complete, remember the flavor text about spinning
      each leaf 180 degrees.  Turn each tile of each clover 180 degrees, and look
      for nearby words that can pair up.

      words on these tiles can be matched to your rotated tiles, you have just to
      look at them from a different angle.

    keywords: turned, flower
    content: 'You now have 16 "clovers": the initial 8 and the 8 more that were formed
      by rotating each tile 180 degrees.  These clovers must pair up to form 8 flowers.  As
      shown in the diagram, each flower has 8 "petals" and uses 4 colors -- the same
      colors as in one of the 4-colored frames (and in the same rotational order).  What
      colors are associated with the clovers you got by rotating tiles?  How can you
      combine one of these clovers gotten from rotating tiles with one of the initial
      clovers to form a flower shape?'

      tile of each set clues pairs of petals
    order: 80.0
    keywords: flowers, extra tile
    content: Now that you've formed 8 flowers, you must use the remaining unused tile
      in each set.  Look at the outer part of each petal; these words should relate
      to the remaining unused tiles.  If you haven't physically/virtually created
      the 8 flowers by overlaying clovers, that may be helpful.

    description: Solvers have created the flowers and identified how the unused tile
      clues pairs of words, but haven't used semaphore
    order: 90.0
    keywords: flower, unused tile, pair
    content: In each set, the unused tile clues 4 pairs of words that appear on the
      outsides of the flower's petals.  Whether the petal word is on the top/bottom
      or left/right of the petal doesn't matter; only which of the 8 petals it appears
      on is relevant.  Each of these pairs yields a letter using a common code.  The
      letters are ordered by clockwise ordering of words from the unused tile.  This
      will give one 4-letter word for each of the 8 flowers.

    keywords: four-letter words, semaphore, pair
    content: 'The 8 4-letter words must be paired up, using the same pairing as was
      used in the "cross-pollination step" (rotated version of the clover from set
      A matches with original clover from set B, and rotated version of B matches
      with A).  Each of these pairs clues one final word, whose lengths and operations
      (colors) are given at the bottom of the puzzle.  The first letters of the answers
      in order are: W (3 letters), C (6 letters), F (4 letters), P (4 letters).'
