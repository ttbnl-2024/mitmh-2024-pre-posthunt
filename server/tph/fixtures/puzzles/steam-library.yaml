    content: This is a meta-matching set. The minipuzzles use the given answers, much
      like a metapuzzle uses feeder answers. We don't tell you which feeder goes to
      which meta, though -- that's for you to figure out! The Binding of Isaac puzzle
      is the finale, and uses the answers from the other 6 puzzles.

      \ of the minimetas to see if they could give you a starting point. The only\
      \ one we recommend saving for when you have fewer answers is Dave the Diver,\
