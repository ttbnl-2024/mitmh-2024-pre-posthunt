    keywords: answered, stuck
    content: We'll throw you a lifeline and say that the question format is reminiscent
      of a game show whose titular cash prize is more impressive 20 years ago thanks
      to inflation.

    keywords: answered, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, stuck
    content: We got you some WWTBAM questions (but not real WWTBAM questions, that's
      a dead end). Read the questions again and figure out who else has plans for
      spending the money.

    keywords: who, spending the money
    content: If I had a million dollars, I'd attend a show by the band who sang "One
      Week", "Call and Answer", and "Pinch Me". We wouldn't have to search for lyrics
      in the puzzle, but we would search for lyrics - we'd just search more!

    content: If I had a million dollars, I wouldn't have to go on Who Wants to Be
      a Millionaire. Or maybe I would, to get more money. There are 15 stages in the
      game. Use the nonzero part of the prize value (for large numbers, read the
      digits separately) to index into the correct answers.
