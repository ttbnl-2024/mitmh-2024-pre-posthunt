    content: Each "spell" Medea casts is a series of five gestures; each gesture is
      an American Sign Language (ASL) letter; the five letters spell a five-letter
      English word (which may include proper names).

    content: Each group of five spells (Medea's original castings and her recastings
      using Ken's suggestions) represents a Wordle grid of five words. When Ken says
      a gesture/letter can stay where it is, that's a "green" letter in Wordle, and
      when he says a gesture can be kept but should be moved elsewhere, that's a "yellow"
      gesture. There is only one possible five-letter word that can complete each
      grid and it is never a word that's already guessed. Additionally, one of the
      comments Ken makes after each series of spells is a crossword-style clue for
      the ultimate answer.

      and the effects of the spells.

    keywords: first, one
    content: Making Ken's changes in the first audition yield the instruction, "SHIFT
      WORDS THREE SLOTS RIGHT." Apply this instruction to all of the initial spell
      words, so SITAR becomes TARSI, etc.

    content: Making Ken's changes in the second audition yields the instruction, "PIVOT
      FRAME THREE RIGHT TURNS." Apply this instruction to the 5x5 grid, so the "D"
      in "STAND" is now at the top left instead of the top right, making the top row
      "DELES." and four new words in the next four rows.

    description: Solvers don't understand how to extract a word from the second grid
      in the third clip.
    order: 2.4
    keywords: third, three
    content: This is a logic puzzle. Ken mentions that the spells have gotten progressively
      better, with no green letters in the first spell and four green letters in the
      fifth spell. So we know that none of the letters in TORTE are used, but the
      final answer is one letter off from BASIN. In order for only two letters in
      MUSIC to be incorrect, the final answer must either be MASIN (not a word), BUSIN
      (also not a word), or BASIC (the only possible answer).

    content: 'Peller has a British accent, so he doesn''t use American ASL: he uses
      British BSL. Translating his gesture list to BSL yields the following phrase:
      QUOTE EVERY SEVEN INTRO WORDS. Ken specifically designates one of his speeches
      as the "intro," so count every seven words, starting from the seventh word,
      ("first") moving to the 14th word ("five"), the 21st word ("answers"), etc.'
