    content: This meta has seven puzzles.  Each of the seven rows has two sets of
      star ratings.  You will need to match each puzzle answer to a specific row with
      two star ratings to proceed.

    content: Each row contains two star ratings with between four and six stars in
      total between them.  Each answer is between four and six letters long.  Each
      row with a given number of stars award will be matched with an answer the same
      number of letters.

    keywords: getting started, start
    content: Each awarded star corresponds to a letter in the answer associated with
      a given pair of star ratings.  This isn't quite enough to match answers to pairs
      of ratings uniquely, but it may help you understand how the star ratings will
      help you (and thus how you can match the answers to the pairs of ratings).

      stars, but is stuck on what to do next.
    order: 50.0
    keywords: stuck, aha
    content: Each awarded star in a pair of ratings corresponds to a letter in an
      associated answer, giving you an answer divided into left and right sides, and
      a gap between them.  What might go in the gap?

      left and right sides of words, but don't know what to do next.
    order: 80.0
    keywords: extraction
    content: For each correctly matched answer/pair of ratings combination, it is
      possible to put one letter of the answer on each awarded star, and one of two
      distinct letters in the gap between the ratings, to form two new words.  You
      will need both of those distinct letters to solve this metapuzzle.

    keywords: extraction
    content: For each correctly matched answer/pair of ratings combination, it is
      possible to put one letter of the answer on each awarded star, and one of two
      distinct letters in the gap between the ratings, to form two new words. If you
      write the answer letters on the awarded stars, it is possible to write both
      the letters which can be inserted in each answer word in the gaps between their
      answer. You can then read the final answer by reading down one column of letters,
      then the other.
