    description: Solvers have identified the primary Greek figures but have not found
      the other figures in the toss-up
    order: 1.0
    keywords: start, begin, first step
    content: Take a closer look at the individual lines of the toss-up questions.
      Doing a search for Aphrodite's father or Cetus might yield some interesting
      information that will explain the three point values in the toss-up as well
      as the flag bank.

    description: Solvers need a stronger clue to find the other figures in the toss
      up questions
    order: 1.5
    keywords: stuck, toss up
    content: Two lines in each toss up are valid for another mythical figure in addition
      to the primary subject of the toss up. For instance, although the Iliad calls
      Zeus the father of Aphrodite, other sources like the Theogony put Uranus in
      that role. The enumerations of the names are given in the points value of the
      last line and the flag bank indicates the origins of all the figures in this
      puzzle.
