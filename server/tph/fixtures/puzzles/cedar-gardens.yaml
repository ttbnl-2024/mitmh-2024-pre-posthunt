    description: Solvers aren't sure each carving is a rollercoaster (but they've
      at least mentioned they tried this, or think they're more generic amusement
      park rides) or don't know how this relates to the park picture
    order: 50.0
    keywords: carving, rollercoaster, park, trees
    content: Each carving is a rollercoaster, and where it is located in the US is
      important.  The picture of all the trees has one type of tree per rollercoaster.

      state trees in the bottom park picture
    order: 100.0
    keywords: extraction, state
    content: Index into each rollercoaster name by the number of corresponding trees.  The
      ordering is clued in the flavortext, which refers to the rollercoasters (not
      the trees).
