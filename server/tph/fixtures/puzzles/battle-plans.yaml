    content: All of the talk about battle plans and ships might suggest "battleships"
      to you.  There is, in fact, a logic puzzle type called "Battleships" (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(puzzle)
      for details), although the version presented here uses pairs of letters instead
      of drawn ship segments.   Please note that pairs of letters already in each
      grid are the cloud cover referred to in the flavor text, rather than ships in
      your fleet or any plausible enemy ships.

    content: "As suggested by the bigrams already visible in the grids, the ship \"\
      words\" under the grid will be entered two letters at a time.  Even understanding\
      \ that, however, there is no solution for each puzzle if ships are understood\
      \ to not cross the bigrams in the grid, and multiple solutions if the ships\
      \ are understood to ignore them..\r\n\r\nThe flavortext talks about ships hiding\
      \ under the clouds.  If the bigrams already in the grid are understood to be\
      \ clouds, what does that suggest about finding a single correct solution for\
      \ each grid?"

    content: In this battleships puzzle, the ships hide under the cloud cover (given
      bigrams).  For each diagram, there is only one way for the ships to hide one
      or more of their bigrams under the clouds (so that they are no longer seen)
      in a way that new words are spelled by a combination of the ships segments and
      the cloud segments for every ship.

    content: Most Battleships puzzles include submarines (one-cell ships); this puzzle
      has an asterisk where they would be in the ship list.  While there are no submarines
      in the main logic puzzle part of this puzzle, that doesn't mean there are no
      submarines in this puzzle at all...

    content: There are five one-cell submarines in each puzzle which are not on the
      ship list (they must be submerged) but which can nevertheless be placed.  Place
      those five submarines according to standard Battleships rules, and observe which
      cloud segments certain submarines are under.
