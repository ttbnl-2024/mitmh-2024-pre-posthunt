    content: This puzzle is about Rubik's cubes where face direction matters. Try
      assembling the cubes (using the standard coloring) and solving them. You might
      find https://rubiks-cube-solver.com/ helpful as a solving tool.

    content: You're correct that some of the cubes are not solvable -- this is a Puzzle
      with a Twist, after all. There are various kinds of twists in play here, which
      connect to the given number for each cube. You might find https://rubiks-cube-solver.com/

    description: Solvers are trying to work out the errors on the example cubes, and
      are getting confused
    order: 15.0
    keywords: ''
    content: Example cube 1 is solveable and therefore has "value" 0. Example cubes
      2-5 each have a particular kind of error that give them values 1, 2, 4, and
      12. Can you derive why the last example cube has value 23?

    order: 20.0
    keywords: ''
    content: There are 4 distinct errors we can introduce into a Rubik's cube with
      numbers on the faces. The first is a rotated center; the second is a flipped
      edge; the third is a rotated corner (with 2 wrong states); and the fourth is
      swapped edges.

    description: Solvers are confused about the last example cube
    order: 50.0
    keywords: ''
    content: The last example cube has every kind of error, with one modification
      -- the corner has been rotated once counter-clockwise, equivalent to twice clockwise;
      so we should add 4 twice.

    order: 100.0
    keywords: ''
    content: The possible range of numbers is 0-23. Ignoring error-free cubes, 1-23
      is suspiciously close to 1-26 (and who really needs X, Y, Z anyway?).
