      t know what to do and want a stronger hint"
    order: 3.1
    keywords: twoadic,twoadictropicalgeom
    content: "Multiplication is replaced by addition, addition is replaced by minimization,\
      \ and the 2-adic valuation is the highest power of 2 in the numerator of a fraction\
      \ minus the highest power of 2 in the denominator. For example, 48 = 2^4\xD7\
      3, so the 2-adic valuation of 48 is v(48)=4. As an additional example, v(3/10)=-1.\
      \ \r\n\r\nDo note that subtraction is just adding a negative number, and the\
      \ valuation of a negative number is the same as the positive part, i.e., v(-x)=v(x)."
