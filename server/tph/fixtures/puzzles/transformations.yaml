    description: Solvers don't know what to do with the garbled strings
    order: 0.0
    keywords: start, stuck, clues
    content: Each string is garbled by taking an English sentence and applying some
      transformation to each of its words (such as replacing letter A with letter
      B), then concatenating all of its words removing spaces.  You must identify
      the original sentence and what transformation was applied.

      them or identified them as being parts of myths
    order: 30.0
    keywords: decoded, sentences
    content: The ungarbled sentences must be grouped and ordered within each group
      to form 6 separate stories, one for each of the sequences in the image.  Each
      story has a number of sentences equal to the number of arrows in its sequence.

      put words into the blanks
    order: 50.0
    keywords: myths, blanks
    content: For each story (which comes from grouping and ordering the ungarbled
      sentences), start from a certain starting word.  Then apply the transformation
      by which each sentence was garbled, in order, to get the (reasonably common
      English) words that go in the blanks, with the last sentence transforming the
      final blank into the shown image.  The starting and ending word (image) relate
      to the story in a way that is common to all the chains.

    order: 70.0
    keywords: filled, garbled, clue
    content: For each chain left-to-right take the starred letters from top to bottom
      to get another garbled clue of 6 words.  The transformation garbling this clue
      involves replacing two letters with other letters and deleting the 3rd-from-last
      letter.

    description: Solvers have decoded the extracted garbled clue
    order: 100.0
    keywords: decoded, extraction
    content: The decoded final clue mentions someone from Greek myth, but applying
      the transformation by which the clue was garbled to her name does not work.  In
      the myth being referenced what happened to her, in a way that relates to the
      starts and ends of the 6 transformation chains?
