      \ cast Motivated Pony, have it enter the battlefield on d1, and then cast Serpent's\
      \ Gift to give it Deathtouch. Then because it has Haste, it can immediately\
      \ attack MotivatedPonyxf2.\r\n\r\nGuard Duty is a spell you can cast on your\
      \ turn, that will make one creature unable to attack."

    content: Imagine it were Black to move in the diagram. Then 1... Ke7 would be
      an illegal move, because it would put the king in check (from Nc6, Time Walk,
      Nxe7).

    content: "Creature types determine a creature's chess moves. Most creature types,\
      \ like \"Elf\" and \"Human,\" don't give any chess moves.\r\n\r\nThe solution\
      \ may be unintuitive, since it's a double check that could never happen in a\

    order: 6.0
    keywords: Bloodshed Fever, sixth
    content: To "attack" is to move. Therefore, the Black king can never move, which
      should make it very easy to checkmate. Unfortunately, your bishop must attack
      every turn if able. The words "if able" are crucial here. Your bishop isn't
      able to attack on your first turn, because you have no legal bishop moves. Can
      you make that happen again?

      \ tempo. Which of the 3 squares it moves to doesn't matter.)\r\n\r\nIt's impossible\

    description: The eighth subpuzzle.
    order: 8.0
    keywords: Nimbus, eighth
    content: "To \"attack\" is to move. Therefore, by activating Rage Nimbus on your\
      \ opponent's turn before their combat phase, you can choose what your opponent\
      \ moves -- though you can't choose where they move to.\r\n\r\nNote that Rage\
      \ Nimbus says the creature must attack \"if able.\" Let me clarify what \"if\
      \ able\" means, because the exact rule is important. Say you activate Rage Nimbus\
      \ targeting your opponent's h6 pawn, but don't move your king away from h5,\
      \ so that the pawn isn't \"able\" to move. The Magic the Gathering rules say\
      \ that a player must satisfy as many \"if able\" requirements as possible. In\
      \ that example, the maximum number of \"if able\" requirements Black can satisfy\
      \ is 0, so they can freely choose from any move that satisfies 0 requirements."

      \ you don't have enough white mana to cast it.\r\n\r\nThis isn't obvious, but\
      \ there's no mate in 2 without Irregular Cohort. So you need another card that\

      \ Path of Mettle, you need to attack with two creatures at once. Don't worry\
