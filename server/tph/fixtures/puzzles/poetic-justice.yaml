    content: "In each pair of clues, one gives an eleven letter word. The other clue\
      \ gives a ten letter word. Both of these words are the same except one letter\
      \ is dropped from the eleven letter word to make the ten letter one. For example:\r\
      \n\r\nA forceful statement of something that is true: This solves to PREDIC[A]TION;\r\
      \nA guess about events you'll later view: This solves to PREDICTION.\r\n\r\n\
      The dropped letter is A."

    keywords: Extract, poem type
    content: "The type of poetry clued by the flavor is a heroic couplet. The format\
      \ for these is two rhyming lines that each have 10 syllables. \r\n\r\nNotice\
      \ that in your pairs of clues, one clue has ten syllables and the other has\
      \ eleven. This is what's wrong with the couplets in the puzzle!"

    keywords: extract, clue, syllable
    content: Notice that the 10 syllable clue corresponds to the 10 letter word and
      the 11 letter clue corresponds to the 11 letter line. This means that we can
      map each letter to a syllable in the clue.

    content: "Look at the extra letter in the 11 letter clue. Take its position in\
      \ the word and find the corresponding syllable in the same position in its clue.\
      \ For example:\r\n\r\nPREDIC[A]TION- A forceful statement of something that\
      \ is true;\r\nPREDICTION- A guess about events you'll later view.\r\n\r\nThe\
      \ extra letter is the seventh letter of PREDICATION, so we take \"some\" which\
      \ is the seventh syllable of the clue.\r\n\r\nStringing these together should\
      \ give you the final clue phrase."
