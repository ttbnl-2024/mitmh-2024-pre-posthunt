    keywords: Song ID, Identification
    content: There are 12 different styles of clues in this puzzle, all requiring
      different methods to ID the songs. Tools like Soundhound and Shazam are a great
      place to start for the more straightforward audio clips. If they seem a little
      more tricky, Google Voice Assistant has a nice built-in feature you might be
      interested in.

    order: 1.1
    keywords: Counting The Beat, List of Numbers, Groups of Numbers, Piano, Keyboard
    content: This part of the puzzle is based on the game of the same name from the
      show "Spicks and Specks". Starting at middle C = 1, each subsequent number represents
      a half-step up with 13 being the C one octave higher. Play the notes on a keyboard
      (or another instrument) in the pattern indicated by the numbers, and see if
      you can recognize the tunes by ACDC, Bonnie Tyler, The Choirboys, and Kylie
      Minogue.

    content: The trivia questions in The Final Countdown are clues to a famous Australian
      actor, actress, or director. You will be able to match each of these personalities
      to exactly one film whose soundtrack has been featured in this puzzle. You will
      have noticed that the films are already ordered alphabetically, so you need
      to reorder them based on the order of appearance of each of the Australian personalities.

      aren't on the soundtracks or are stuck on extraction.
    order: 4.0
    keywords: Extraction, Index, Bonus Songs, Extra Songs, Australian Songs
    content: You will see that in each round, one extra song has been included that
      doesn't show up on a film soundtrack. This song is also always by an Australian
      artist or group. Try finding the highest position these "off-track" songs appeared
      on the weekly ARIA charts or Kent Music Report and using that as an index into
      previously unused information.
