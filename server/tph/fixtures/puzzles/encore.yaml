    description: Solvers have finished the pattern and don't know how to extract.
    order: 3.0
    keywords: done, finished, extraction, now what
    content: Try looking at your shapes to see if you can read a 7 letter word from
      it. Blocking might help if your finished object is a little twisted because
      of tension accrued during the crafting. You should start with where the pattern
      begins and read clockwise. Make sure you haven't flipped it the wrong way.
