    description: The solver doesn't know what to do or how to get started
    order: 10.0
    keywords: Getting started, start
    content: The words on the posterboards are important, the three-grid-cell-columns
      on the posterboards are important, the locations where the photos were taken
      are important, and unless you're Of A Certain Age, the puzzle's title will be
      important as well.  A little web-search should help you figure out why.

    keywords: title, stuck
    content: If you're having trouble working out the significance of the title, remember
      that despite the extra flavor of working "Pluto" and "IHTFP" into the title
      of this puzzle, you're probably looking for something earthbound and not MIT-specific.

    content: Both the title and the provided photos are a reference to a specific
      Bob Dylan song (and as the flavortext suggests, music video).

    order: 30.0
    keywords: Subterranean Homesick Blues, words, placard, posterboard
    content: Some of the placards on the photos - particularly the ones with WHEEEEEEE
      and PIPING HOT, PI- CNIC HAM, should be very reminiscent of some of the placards
      in the music video for Subterranean Homesick Blues.  By observing what these
      having in common, you should be able to find matches for the other 16 placards.

    description: The solvers are ready to go to campus and look for photo locations,
      but they want to solve the puzzle without doing so if they can
    order: 50.0
    keywords: photo, location, identification, looks very hard, I don't wanna, remote
    content: Most if not all teams will be unable to complete the location identification
      without leaving their HQ, though we are aware of at least one YouTube video
      which will help with one or more of the locations.  There is one particular
      photo whose location is very identifiable; it's a good place to start.  We also
      recommend that you look at all of the photos closely; there is something that
      most of them have in common which will help you find the other locations which
      are less identifiable or distinct from each other.

    order: 50.1
    keywords: photo, location, identification, looks very hard, I don't wanna, remote
    content: Most of the photos have a little squarish white sign in them, and all
      of those little white signs in the photos have something deliberately covered
      over in the photo.  Finding even one of those signs will help you find the locations
      for the other 17.  This means finding the location of the photo with a building
      number in it (which is probably the easiest photo to find the location for)
      will be very helpful for finding the other photo locations.

      to draw your attention to the words on the music video's placards corresponding
      to PED PTH and to WORDS BLAZOND.

    description: The solver has identified that Braille and Pigpen are important,
      but does not know what to do next
    order: 80.0
    keywords: extraction, Braille, pigpen
    content: Grid pieces with one row and three columns are the perfect size to be
      arranged in a long row for reading off Braille and for reading off Pigpen.  The
      dots in the grid cells are of different colors and in the case of the red dots,
      of different sizes.  (If you are visually impaired, the alt text will help you
      differentiate here.)  This means that one color of dots is more likely to be
      Braille and the other is more likely to be Pigpen.

    description: The solver knows how to extract Braille and Pigpen, but does not

    order: 90.0
    keywords: extraction, Braille, pigpen
    content: The ordering for the Pig Pen - the extraction corresponding to the PED
      PTH placard - is a pedestrian-paths-related ordering.  Put the columns in the
      order of the letters on the MIT Get Fit signs in or near the photos the columns
      are in.  The ordering for the Braille - the extraction corresponding to the
      WORDS BLAZOND placard - is a "blazoned words" ordering.  Put the columns in
      the order that the matching placards for the sign in each photo appear in the
      Dylan music video.
