    description: Solvers don't understand what to do with the rule generator
    order: 10.1
    keywords: rule, generator, random, D&D
    content: You can count how many different rules you have generated.  If you think
      you may not have generated enough, keep going! You will know when you have enough.
      Have you noticed anything about the distribution of the rules? There are five
      rulebooks listed. For each of the rules generated, check which guidebook(s)
      they are valid for.

      and don't know what they'll be doing with them
    order: 10.5
    keywords: rules generator, d20, D&D, idea, guidebooks, check answer
    content: 'The number of rules satisfying the rulesets is, in order: 11, 4, 8,
      9, 8.  If you are not sure about a particular rule, then note that having something
      matching incorrectly may hurt your ability to see what is happening more than
      just leaving it blank.'

    description: Solvers have correctly matched the rules to the guidebook editions
      but have not sorted in order of frequency.
    order: 10.75
    keywords: matched rules, guidebooks
    content: How often does each rule appear when using our generator? You can create
      an ordered list once you figure that out.

    description: Solvers are stuck on getting started with the triangle trivia
    order: 20.1
    keywords: triangle, trivia, enumeration, constraint
    content: You have 60 clues, with the 60 answer enumerations provided. Solve the
      clues and search for commonalities among your answers. This will help you put
      the triangles together as well.

      to figure out the numerical associations
    order: 20.5
    keywords: triangle, trivia, constraint, alternate, group
    content: "Within each group of five, at least one can have an alternate interpretation\
      \ that yields numbers from 1 to 20:\r\nkeyboard keys (ASCII code),\r\nalphabet\
      \ (Roman numeral),\r\nJulius Caesar/Shakespeare (day of month),\r\ncollege majors\
      \ (MIT course number),\r\nbirds (12 days of Christmas),\r\nMonopoly spaces (US\
      \ amendment),\r\nNATO alphabet (month number),\r\n'90s comedy title characters\
      \ (playing cards),\r\nnutrients (atomic number),\r\nDutch soccer (words that\
      \ resemble numbers),\r\nRed Sox players (jersey number),\r\ncelestial objects\
      \ (Tarot major arcana number)."

    description: Solvers have most of the triangle clues solved and may have most
      of the groupings, too
    order: 20.9
    keywords: triangle, trivia, group, extraction
    content: You may observe that opposite faces of the d20 always add up to 21.  It
      may be helpful to construct a physical d20, or you can lay it out in a planar
      way, so that it is convenient to see how the other part of the puzzle interacts
      with this part (shading -- keep it continuous rather than broken up).

      but haven't put both parts together
    order: 30.1
    keywords: rule, d20, D&D, extraction
    content: You now have a d20 constructed. Look at the selection of numbers for
      each guidebook to highlight your next step.

    description: Solvers have both parts figured out separately, but can't extract
    order: 100.0
    keywords: extraction, triangle, rule, complete
    content: You get one letter per ruleset (the order is chronological by ruleset).  Each
      ruleset can be considered separately for extraction.  If you seem to have poorly
      shaped letters, you may want to recheck your rule assignments.  An incorrect
      assignment may be more misleading/confusing than leaving a rule blank.
