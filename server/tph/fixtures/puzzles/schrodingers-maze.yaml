    content: Each word input is interpreted as instructions for the maze. Your word
      is matched with your maze and the output (in the form of probabilities of 3
      possible end states) is given. The first step is to figure out how the word
      is interpreted as instructions which could lead to some probabilities.

    description: Solvers need a stronger hint on the mechanism
    order: 10.0
    keywords: start
    content: Each letter of the word is interpreted as 2 different directions (from
      N, S, E, W, NW, NE, SW, SE), and the player is moved in one of the two directions
      with 1/2 probability each. Experiment with different words and mazes to figure
      out what these directions are, and what happens when the player moves into a
      block, a wave, or the edge of the maze.

      secret words
    order: 30.1
    keywords: semaphore,mechanism
    content: You can place multiple flags. If you completely surround the player with
      flags and waves, you can figure out the first letter of the word. If you let
      the player take one step, then surround it with flag and waves, you can figure
      out the 2nd letter, and so on. Something happens when you input the exact word.

    content: "A useful tactic is trying short words, which will give you some information\
      \ on the surrounding cells, especially which are waves. Another tactic is guessing\
      \ a path to the flag and finding a word which takes that path.\r\n\r\nSomething\
      \ happens when you input the exact maze."

    content: Notice that each word solves exactly one maze. For each such pair, when
      does the player reach the flag?
