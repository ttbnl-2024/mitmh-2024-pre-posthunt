# Notes:
# 1. Each interaction must have its own slug.
#    Interactions are joined to the puzzle via the `puzzle` attribute, so the
#    slugs do not need to -- but can -- correspond to the puzzle slug.
#    Interaction slugs have a uniqueness constraint, so they can't repeat.
# 2. The pk fields need to be unique (obviously) but do not need to be
#    sequential. Here I made pk, order, and required_pseudoanswer all the
#    same value.
# 3. The required_pseudoanswer field should the match the pk of the
#    pseudoanswer that is needed to unlock the interaction.
# 4. The name is only visible to the HQ, so you can put spoilery things there.
# 5. The slug is technically only visible to the HQ, but it's probably bestrequest a team interaction for the Minüêü Games sub-puzzle. [finish this text]
#    not to put anything spoilery there. For this puzzle I just made them
#    sequential.
# 6. The first sub-puzzle does not have an interaction -- it writes a 
#    Minipuzzle and a MinipuzzleSubmission, and puts the result of that into
#    the private part of PuzzleData.
