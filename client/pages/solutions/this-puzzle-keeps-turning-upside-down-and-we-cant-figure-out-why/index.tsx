      . Ok, nowâ€¦
    </p>
    <p>
      This puzzle is based on the popular Australian (hence why the puzzle is
      upside down) show <i>Spicks and Specks</i>, a music-themed comedic television
      quiz show first airing in 2005, in which the host, Adam Hills, asks two
      teams, of three people each, varying music-themed questions in different
      games. The theme song used for the show is appropriately, the song Spicks
      and Specks by the Bee Gees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presented like a playlist, with several rounds or "Tracks", each
      mini-puzzle/round/track is based on a round from the show and has the same
      name (although some creative liberty has been taken to make the puzzle
      more like a puzzle, and a few games have been altered to give solutions
      that are song titles instead of artists. Each image, clue, audio file, or
      question takes the form of a style of question that has been previously
      asked on the show, and its solution is either a well-known song or an
      Australian actor/director for the final round. The wikipedia page for the
      show outlines how each game would work, and we can use those descriptions
      to help us solve this puzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once we have figured out how each round is supposed to work and we have
      started to identify some of the songs for each "Track", we need to make
      the realisation that these are all songs that comprise the "soundtracks"
      of popular Australian films (or films with an Australian lead
      actor/actress). Both the songs and film titles have been organised
      alphabetically to make this slightly easier. The licensed songs appearing
      on each soundtrack* are presented in each round, except for one extra song
      from an Australian band or artist that has been included. Extracting the
      highest position that each "bonus" song appeared on the Australian ARIA or
      Kent music charts into the film title, and sorting the films by matching
      them with the actors from the twelfth and final round will give the
      answer.

        Ok, so you have gotten this far and are probably wondering why AC/DC
        hasn't made an appearance yet. Wellâ€¦ here you are provided with a list
        of numbers. Playing those numbered notes on a keyboard (assuming middle
        C as 1 and using the relative distances between all 12 notes) will play
        a recognisable tune, however most likely not with the same rhythm as the
        original song, which makes this an evil task (however it is still
        doable, as evidenced by the many episodes from the show where this was
        successful). Almost every song in this round appeared on the soundtrack

        You may have missed it, but even the name of the playlist itself
        provides subtle clues to solving this puzzle. I will let you go back and
        try to work out what they are on your own. Fun fact&mdash;each of the round
        names from the show (and this puzzle) are derived from the names of
        songs (
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spicks_and_Specks_(TV_series)">
          <i>Spick and Specks</i>
        </a>
        ).
      </p>
    </Appendix>
    <AuthorsNotes>
      <p>
        This puzzle has been designed as a homage to the show <i>Spicks and Specks</i>,
        which formed part of my childhood, and that my family would (and still
        continues to) watch most weeknights after dinner. So if you like music
        of any kind, and you like comedy, and you like trivia, and you like
        Aussies (in fact they have guests on the show from all over the world)â€¦
        wellâ€¦ at least give it a look!
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the sheer size of this puzzle, I enlisted the help of Todd
        Becker, who was responsible for the brilliant piano renditions of the
        songs on the Barbie soundtrack, and Jeremy Horwitz who kindly did the
        research and wrote the trivia questions for The Final Countdown. JJ
        mainly existed in a moral-support capacity, but we had a ton of fun
        listening to Aussie music and looking at Aussie films throughout the
        writing process.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really wanted to use the <i>Iron Man 2</i> soundtrack at some point because
        it's AC/DC and it's awesome, but I went with <i>Thunderstruck</i> instead
        because it was more thematic. Maybe I will write a sequel puzzle ;)
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I would like to thank our awesome editors for pretty much
        letting us have free reign on this puzzle to do whatever we wanted with
        little constraints, while also providing great suggestions (Bella came
        up with the extraction idea and Paul the playlist title).
