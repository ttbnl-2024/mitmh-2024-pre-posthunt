      There are a few theories and concepts we can glean by reviewing the puzzle
      as presented, and, if we choose to invest the time, the flavortext
      <sup>
        <a id="ref1" href="#fn1">
          1
        </a>

      and title
      <sup>
        <a id="ref2" href="#fn2">

      A glance through the 41 bulleted memories show a lot of "today" type words
      at the top and "foggy memory" words at the bottom. This is a clue that the
      list is presented in chronological order. One other thing we observe is
      that there are 10 clues with the phrase "How could I forget" and 10 cities
      at the bottom of the puzzle, each in a different country. By using a map
      tool, we can identify them and see what they may have in common with each
      other and the clues. For example, we could try to follow the first clue
      and see if these cities have any recent world records. As it turns out,
      Astana has the Guiness world record for the most name changes in modern
      times. This tells us the puzzle is about city name changes over the years.
    </p>
    <p>
      This puzzle requires some Research Puzzle techniques in order to solve
      efficiently, in this case regarding both etymology and historical context.
      For example - we see that Istanbul, probably the most famous changed-name
      city out there, is represented at the bottom of the puzzle. Once we
      pinpoint Istanbul, Constantinople, Byzantium and so forth in the
      chronology, it sets timeline points for more searching for and identifying
      other cities. As we can imagine, the earlier we go, the fuzzier the "which
      was before which" is known, especially as it goes earlier than written
      records. Some of the clues are therefore referring to specific events,
      such as Cartier visiting Hochelaga in 1535 which is the year that is used
      for the puzzle. The truly timeless ancient ones are simply stacked at the
      bottom with "foggy memory". There is also the enumerations for each city
      and a letter pool to help with spelling them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we work through the cities, it will become apparent that the ones with
      "How could I forget!" are "out of time". As the work is completed, we will
      see that a missing name in one city's history has its etymology referenced
      in the timeline at the year/era of one of the other cities on the list. We
      find that the mis-associations will loop, allowing us to chain the cities
      in an order. Tsaritsyn's clue has an added part,{' '}
      <i>
        "I also just remembered that to fix my memory disorder, this memory
        should be placed last."
      </i>{' '}
      which further clues the loop and that Tsaritsyn should be placed last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally&mdash;with a heavy nod to the flavortext, it is the number of name
      changes that allow for progress&mdash;we index each of the required names in
      chained order to to spell our final phrase, as seen in the table:

        <i>
          "plus Ã§a change[, plus c'est la mÃªme chose]" - Jean-Baptiste Alphonse
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Goddesses Mnemosyne (M) and Lethe (L) reminisce about things.
        Ostensibly, L seems to quote John the Baptist, but delving into this
        quote a bit, we see that it was not the Biblical prophet but a man
        literally named Jean-Baptiste. Looking into his last name, Alphonse, we
        see its etymology "prepare for battle" or "noble", which explains the
        rest of Lethe's description. "Change" is emphasized to help us with the
        extraction step of the puzzle, though it's also reinforced by "amount of
        changes" a few lines down if we haven't yet considered that the quantity
        of changes, not the number of city names, could be used for indexing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond its mini-puzzle, the flavortext is rife with key concepts and
        words/phrases to help us solve this puzzle: change, meaning, and Lethe's
        mis-remembered memories are presented throughout the puzzle in a similar
        style to the flavortext with etymologies ("what I meant") of a place
        recalled at "the wrong time" in the chronology. There's a reason she's
        the goddess of forgetfulness.

        About the title
      </h3>
      <p>
        Doesn't this wacky title just draw you in? It too can reward us with
        some insight into the puzzle, if we invest a few minutes. This title is
        a unique portion of a former name of Salvador Dali's 1954 work called
        (in English), <i>The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory</i>. This is
        meaningful to the puzzle for two main reasons:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          This puzzle hinges on the apparent disintegration of the persistence
          of Lethe's memories.
        </li>
        <li>
          The 1954 work is hailed as a recreation, reimagining, or simply a
          variation of his original, and much more famous, 1931 work <i>The
          Persistence of Memory</i>. As Wikipedia notes, the 1954 painting portrays
          the earlier work "fragmenting into smaller component elements, and a
          series of rectangular blocks which reveal further imagery through the
          gaps between them, implying something beneath the surface of the
          original." This is a very poignant description of this puzzle.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>3. About the puzzle itself</h3>
      <p>
        The puzzle has gone through multiple changes itself. Version 1 had a lot
        of difficult clues, with the extraction clues being more abstract and no
        city pictures to help you out. Version 2 had revised clues and added the
        pictures. Version 3 had more revised clues and the flavortext was
        revised to add the explicit "amount of changes" hint. Version 4 changed
        to a completely different answer and added the enumerations and letter
        bank. Therefore I think it's safe to say that this puzzle's history is
        quite akin to the cities represented.
