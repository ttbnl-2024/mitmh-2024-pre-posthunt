      We initially see some newspaper headlines with strange images and a set of
      dictionary definitions. After some quick research, we notice that each of
      the historical events happened in the month of December. After thinking
      about the word "revolting" in the title and the flavor text's mention of
      songs, we realize that all of the images depict the titles of songs by The
      Decemberists, in alphabetical order.

      When trying to figure out the words by the dictionary definitions, we
      notice the definitions are mostly straightforward but also that there
      seems to be a superfluous part of each definition. The Decemberists are
      known as a hyperliterate band who like to use uncommon words in their
      lyrics. Eventually, we realize each of these words is found in the lyrics
      of one of the songs depicted in the newspapers. If we take the day in
      December that the associated historical event happened and use it as an
      offset in the lyrics from the defined word (as hinted by the flavor text),
      we get eleven new words, each of which is defined by the superfluous word
      from the dictionary definition.

        This puzzle was originally intended to be a meta that took place at the
        Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and used Bruce Springsteen lyrics. When it
        didn't make the cut, I was very happy to have the opportunity to turn it
        into a puzzle about Decemberists songs. They're my favorite band (most
        of my wall art is posters I bought at their concerts) and they've
        provided the soundtrack to some of the best and worst times of the last
        15 years of my life. I'm sad that I couldn't make The Crane Wife lyrics
        work with this puzzle because the image I created of three construction
        cranes in veils and dresses still makes me laugh every time I look at
        it.
