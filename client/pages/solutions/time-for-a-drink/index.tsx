    <p>
      From the flavor text reference to a concierge wearing a lapel pin with
      golden keys, who is able to get guests anything they want, we realize we
      are dealing with Les Clefs d'Or, the elite society of Ã¼berconcierges.
      Luckily, we can visit their website and see a list of all the{' '}
      <a href="https://www.lcdusa.org/travelers/find-a-hotel/">
        Les Clefs d'Or hotels
      </a>{' '}
      in New York City, along with the names of some of the members.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can immediately identify Richard Branch&mdash;name-checked in the
      flavor text&mdash;as the concierge of the Casa Cipriani, located at The
      Battery, which is confirmation that we're dealing with real-world hotels
      and Clefs d'Or members.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at the rest of the puzzle, we know that our goal is to get to the
      Casa Cipriani and back by 6:00 PM, and we have learned that Janus's hotel
      (our start) is location A on the subway map, and that The Battery Terminal
      (location S) is where the Casa Cipriani is. The timetable notes clearly
      establish that we will be able to jump between two trains at the same
      station at the same time, and that we likely only need to allow five
      minutes at Location S to fetch the wine bottle in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that, we turn to the timetables, which essentially represent a simple
      maze, where only one series of train routes will get us where we need to
      go in time. The correct route is as follows:

      Once we have figured out how to get the wine to Janus, we need to figure
      out an extraction, so we turn to the only remaining feature of the puzzle,
      the Members' Message Board. The boldfaced text clearly indicates that we
      are supposed to take certain letters from the names of Clefs d'Or hotels
      (or their constituent businesses/concierges) when we visit the station
      that serves that hotel. But how can we determine which hotel is served by
      which location?
    </p>
    <p>
      For that, we can look to the subway map itself, which is labeled as being{' '}
      <i>
        "not entirely to scale: distances are approximate. In particular, the
        distance between Stations Q and R has been severely truncated for
        readability."
      </i>{' '}
      So we'll need to map the actual locations of all the Clefs d'Or hotels in
      New York (yes, really). When we do, we see that their locations
      approximate the positions of the stations on the subway map:
    </p>
    <p className="relative">
      <SheetableImage alt="" src={image0} title="" className="w-full" />

      <SheetableImage alt="" src={image1} title="" className="routes-inset" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Together with the note that{' '}
      <i>
        "stations are never located more than one block (uptown or crosstown)
        from the locations served by that station,"
      </i>{' '}
      we can determine from the stations' names (neighborhood or landmark) which
      hotel(s) they serve:
