    <p>
      We are given some question-marked enumerations next to some responses that
      suggest the speaker had not been very clear and should restate things.
      Using the enumerations and the meanings in those responses, we can
      reconstruct the literal, if questionably grammatical, questions using the
      provided word bank. The reconstructed phrases are actually Anguished
      English, a somewhat loose type of phonetic wordplay puzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each anguished phrase can also be read (anguishedly) as the last name of
      the loser of a US presidential election (clued by the flavortext
      completion "It's not whether you win or lose"); and one or two anguished
      state nicknames. This lets us reorder by election year, and look at the
      total number of electoral votes earned by the candidate in those states.
    </p>
    <p>
      (People that lost in multiple years only earned electoral votes from those
      states in one year; Dewey lost in 2 consecutive elections but earned the
      same number of votes from the same states.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, with the elections ordered, and applying electoral votes
      additively for those phrases containing two states, the number associated
      with each is a letter of the alphabet from 1 to 26, yielding a phrase that
      involves some other election losers who had won some electoral votes in
      other elections not used in the puzzle:{' '}
      <Clue>GORE AND DOLE DEAF LAG</Clue>.
    </p>
    <p>
      That phrase parses to the final enumeration, and the rejoinder confirms
      (in meaning and placement) that this will lead us to the final answer.
      Reading this phrase as a final Anguished English phrase will yield the
      final puzzle answer: <Answerize>{ANSWER}</Answerize>.
